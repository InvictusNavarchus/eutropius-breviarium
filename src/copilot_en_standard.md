# Preface

**To Lord Valens, the Eternal Augustus, Greatest of the Goths**

**Eutropius, Master of Memory**

I have compiled a brief narrative of Roman affairs from the founding of the city to our own time, highlighting events that stood out in matters of war and civil administration. Additionally, I have included remarkable deeds of illustrious men in their governance, so that your divine mind may rejoice in the accomplishments of those who administered the empire before you, even before reading.

## Book 1: From the Founding of Rome to the Capture of the City by the Gauls, 753 – 390 BCE. The Regal Period, 753 – 509 BCE 

### Chapter 1: Rome Founded, 753 BCE. Romulus, 753 – 716 BCE 

(1) The Roman Empire, which can scarcely be recalled from its very beginning or surpassed in its subsequent growth by human memory, traces its origin to Romulus. He was born of Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin, and, as is believed, of Mars. 

(2) While he was living among shepherds, at the age of eighteen, he founded the small city on the Palatine Hill. This occurred on the eleventh day before the Kalends of May, in the third year of the sixth Olympiad, after the fall of Troy, according to the most reliable accounts, in the four hundred and ninety-fourth year from the founding of the city.

### Chapter 2 

(1) After establishing the city, which he named Rome after himself, Romulus did the following: he admitted a multitude of neighboring people into the city, selected one hundred senators from the elderly, whose advice he followed, and appointed them senators due to their advanced age.

(2) Then, since neither he nor his people had wives, he invited the neighboring nations and the daughters of the Sabines to a spectacle of games. Stirred by the wars due to the outrage against the abducted women, he conquered the Caeninenses, Antemnates, Crustumini, Sabines, and Veientes. All these towns surround Rome. And when a sudden storm arose, he was believed to have been taken up to the gods in the thirty-seventh year of his reign and was consecrated. Afterward, for five days, the senators ruled in Rome, and during their reign, one year was completed.

### Chapter 3: Numa Pompilius, 715 – 672 BCE 

(1) Next, Numa Pompilius was chosen as king. Although he waged no wars, he benefited the state no less than Romulus.

(2) For he established laws and customs for the Romans, who were already considered half-barbarians due to their habit of fighting. He also divided the year into ten months without any precise calculation, and he instituted countless sacred rites and temples in Rome. He died in the forty-third year of his reign.

### Chapter 4: Tullus Hostilius, 672 – 640 BCE 

(1) Tullus Hostilius succeeded him. He renewed wars, defeated the Albans, who were twelve miles from Rome, and conquered the Veientes and Fidenates, some of whom were six miles away from Rome, while others were eighteen miles away. He expanded the city by adding the Caelian Hill.

(2) After reigning for thirty-two years, he was struck by lightning and consumed with his house.

### Chapter 5: Ancus Marcius, 640 – 616 BCE 

(1) Following him, Ancus Marcius, the grandson of Numa, assumed power.

(2) He engaged in conflict with the Latins. He added the Aventine Hill to the city and founded a city above the sea at the mouth of the Tiber River, sixteen miles from Rome. In the twenty-fourth year of his reign, he died of illness.

### Chapter 6: Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, 616 – 578 BCE 

(1) Then Priscus Tarquinius took the throne. He doubled the number of senators, built structures around Rome, and established Roman games that endure in our memory. He also conquered the Sabines and added considerable territory to the city of Rome. As the first triumphant leader, he entered the city.

(2) He constructed walls and sewers and began the construction of the Capitoline Hill. In the thirty-eighth year of his reign, he was killed by the sons of Ancus, the king he had succeeded.

### Chapter 7: Servius Tullius, 578 – 534 BCE 

(1) After this, Servius Tullius assumed power. He was born of a noble woman but was a captive and a slave. He also subdued the Sabines and added three hills—Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline—to the city. He constructed ditches around the walls. He was the first to establish a census, which until then was unknown throughout the world.

(2) During his reign, Rome had a census of eighty-three thousand Roman citizens, including those in the countryside. He was killed by the treachery of his son-in-law, Tarquin the Proud, the son of the former king, along with his daughter, whom Tarquin had married.

### Chapter 8: Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, 534 – 510 BCE 

(1) L. Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last of the kings, defeated the Volsci, a tribe not far from Rome as one travels toward Campania. He conquered the cities of Gabii and Suessa Pometia, made peace with the Etruscans, and built a temple to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. Later, while besieging Ardea, a city located sixteen miles from Rome, he lost his power.

(2) The cause of his downfall was the infamous act committed by his son, Tarquin the Younger. Tarquin violated the most noble woman, Lucretia, who was also the most chaste. She complained of the injustice to her husband, father, and friends, and in the presence of all, she took her own life. For this reason, Brutus, who was also a relative of Tarquin, incited the people and removed Tarquin from power.

(3) Soon, even the army that was besieging the city of Ardea with the king abandoned him. Tarquin, with his wife and children, fled after reigning for twenty-four years. Thus, Rome was ruled by seven kings for two hundred and forty-three years, during which time Rome possessed only a small territory, barely reaching fifteen miles.

### Chapter 9: Establishment of the Republic. Election of Consuls, 509 BCE 

(1) From this point, the consulship began. Two consuls were chosen instead of one king, with the purpose that if one turned out to be wicked, the other, having similar authority, could restrain him.

(2) It was also decided that they should not hold power for more than a year, so that prolonged authority would not make them insolent, and they would always remain citizens who knew that they would return to private life after a year.

(3) In the first year after the expulsion of the kings, the consuls were Lucius Junius Brutus, who had worked tirelessly to drive out Tarquin, and Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia.

(4) However, Collatinus was immediately stripped of his dignity. It had been agreed that no one bearing the name Tarquin should remain in the city. Therefore, Collatinus left the city, taking all his possessions with him, and Lucius Valerius Publicola was appointed consul in his place.

War with Tarquinius 

(5) Nevertheless, Tarquin, the deposed king, stirred up war against Rome. He gathered many nations to restore him to power.

### Chapter 11: War with Porsenna, 508 BCE 

(1) In the second year, Tarquin once again waged war against the Romans, seeking to be restored to power. Porsenna, the king of Etruria, provided him with assistance, and they nearly captured Rome. However, Tarquin was defeated once more.

(2) In the third year after the expulsion of the kings, Tarquin, unable to regain the throne and with Porsenna no longer supporting him, retreated to Tusculum—a city not far from Rome—where he lived in exile with his wife for fourteen years.

(3) In the fourth year after the expulsion of the kings, the Romans waged war against the Sabines and emerged victorious, resulting in a triumph.

(4) In the fifth year, Lucius Valerius, the colleague of Brutus and a four-time consul, met a tragic end. He was so impoverished that the people collected money for his burial. Like Brutus, he was mourned by the Roman matrons.

### Chapter 12: Institution of the Dictatorship, 501 BCE 

(1) In the ninth year after the expulsion of the kings, when Tarquin's son-in-law raised a large army to avenge an injury, a new office was created in Rome called the dictatorship. This office held greater authority than the consulship. In the same year, the position of master of horse (magister equitum) was established to assist the dictator.

(2) There is nothing more similar to this ancient dictatorship than the power your Tranquillitas Vestra holds today. Even Augustus Octavian, whom we will discuss later, and before him, Gaius Caesar, ruled under the name and honor of the dictatorship.

(3) The first dictator in Rome was T. Larcius, and the first master of horse was Sp. Cassius.

### Chapter 13: Secession of the Plebeians. Establishment of the Tribunate, 494 BCE 

(1) In the sixteenth year after the expulsion of the kings, the Roman populace rebelled, feeling oppressed by the Senate and consuls.

(2) At that time, they also created the office of tribunes of the plebs, who acted as their own judges and defenders against the Senate and consuls.

### Chapter 14: War with the Volsci, 493 BCE 

In the following year, the Volsci renewed their war against the Romans. They were defeated in battle, and the city of Corioli, which they had held, was lost.

### Chapter 15: Coriolanus, 491 BCE 

(1) In the eighteenth year after the expulsion of the kings, Quintus Marcius, a Roman general who had captured the Volscian city of Corioli, turned his anger against the Romans themselves and sought aid from the Volsci.

(2) He often defeated the Romans and even advanced to within five miles of the city, intending to attack his own homeland. However, when envoys seeking peace were rejected, his mother Veturia and wife Volumnia came from Rome. Overwhelmed by their tears and pleas, he withdrew his army. Coriolanus became the second leader, after Tarquin, to fight against his own country.

### Chapter 16: Slaughter of the Fabii, 477 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of C. Fabius and L. Virginius, three hundred noble men from the Fabian family undertook war against the Veientes alone, promising to fill the Senate and the people with their own efforts.

(2) Setting out, all these nobles, who individually should have been leaders of great armies, fell in battle.

(3) Only one survived from such a renowned family, who, due to his young age, could not be led into battle. Afterward, a census was held in the city, and they found one hundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and nineteen citizens.

### Chapter 17: Dictatorship of Cincinnatus, 458 BCE 

(1) In the following year, when the Roman army was besieged by the enemy on Mount Algidus, L. Quintius Cincinnatus was appointed dictator. He was cultivating a four-acre field with his own hands.

(2) When he was found working in the field and plowing, he wiped the sweat from his brow, put on his toga praetexta, and, after defeating the enemy in battle, liberated the army.

### Chapter 18: Decemvirs Appointed, 451 BCE. Laws of XII Tables Promulgated, 450 BCE. Death of Virginia; Decemvirs Deposed, 449 BCE 

 (1) In the three hundred and fifty-first year after the founding of the city, the consular government ceased, and ten men were appointed instead of two consuls. These ten men, called decemvirs, held supreme power.

(2) However, in the first year, they governed well. In the second year, one of them, Ap. Claudius, attempted to corrupt the daughter of a certain Virginius, who was serving honorably against the Latins on Mount Algidus. Her father killed her to prevent her from enduring dishonor from the decemvir. In response, the soldiers revolted. The decemvirs were stripped of their power and condemned.

### Chapter 19: Revolt of the Fidenates, 438 BCE 

(1) In the three hundred and fifty-fifth year after the founding of the city, the Fidenates rebelled against the Romans. The Veiens and King Tolumnius supported them.

(2) Both these cities are so close to Rome that Fidenae is six miles away, and Veii is eighteen miles away. They joined forces with the Volsci. However, under the dictatorship of Mam. Aemilius and the leadership of L. Quintius Cincinnatus, the Romans defeated them and even captured the king.

### Chapter 20: War with Veii, 396 BCE 

(1) After twenty years, the Veientani rebelled once again. Dictator Furius Camillus was sent against them. He first defeated them in battle and then, after a long siege, captured their city, the most ancient and wealthiest in Italy.

(2) Afterward, he also captured the city of the Falisci, which was no less renowned. However, he incurred envy due to the perception that he had unfairly divided the spoils. As a result, he was condemned and exiled from the city.

Rome Captured by the Gauls, 390 BCE 

(3) Immediately, the Senonian Gauls came to the city and, after defeating the Romans at the eleventh milestone from Rome near the river Allia, they occupied the city. Nothing could be defended except the Capitoline Hill. After a long siege and with the Romans suffering from hunger, Camillus arrived and decisively defeated the Gauls.

(4) Later, even after receiving gold to prevent the siege of the Capitoline Hill, the Gauls withdrew. Camillus pursued them and recovered both the gold given to them and all the military standards they had captured.

(5) Thus, triumphantly, he entered the city for the third time and was hailed as the second Romulus, as if he himself were the founder of the nation.

## Book 2: From the Capture of the City to the End of the First Punic War, 390 – 241 BCE 

### Chapter 1: Military Tribunes with Consular Power Elected, 444 BCE 

(1) In the three hundred and sixty-fifth year from the founding of the city, after it was first captured, the dignities were changed, and instead of two consuls, military tribunes with consular power were made. From here, the Roman state began to grow.

(2) For Camillus in that year conquered the city of the Volscians, which had waged war for seventy years, and occupied the city of the Aequi and the Sutrini [and] all, having destroyed their armies, and celebrated three triumphs at once.

### Chapter 2 

(1) T. Quintius Cincinnatus also pursued the Praenestines, who had come to the gates of the city of Rome with war, defeated them at the river Allia, added eight cities, which were under them, to the Romans, attacked Praeneste itself and accepted it in surrender.

(2) All these things were accomplished by him in twenty days and a triumph was decreed for him.

### Chapter 3 

But the dignity of the military tribunes did not last long. For after a while it pleased no one to be made and a four-year period flowed in the city, so that there were no greater powers there. However, the military tribunes with consular power again assumed dignity and persevered for three years. Again consuls were made.

### Chapter 4: Death of Camillus, 365 BCE 

L. Genucius and Q. Servilius were consuls, Camillus died. The second honor after Romulus was conferred on him.

### Chapter 5: Invasion of the Gauls; Torquatus, 361 BCE 

T. Quintius dictator was sent against the Gauls, who had come to Italy. They had settled from the city at the fourth mile across the Anio river. There the most noble of the senators, a young man L. Manlius, went forward against a Gaul who had challenged him to single combat, killed him and, having lifted the golden torque and placed it on his own neck, he took the nickname Torquatus for himself and his descendants forever. The Gauls were put to flight, soon even defeated by C. Suplicius dictator. Not long after, the Tuscans were defeated by C. Marcius and eight thousand prisoners from them were led in triumph.

### Chapter 6: First Samnite War, 343 – 341 BCE 

(1) The census was taken again. And when the Latins, who had been subdued by the Romans, did not want to provide soldiers, only recruits were chosen from the Romans, and ten legions were made, which mode produced sixty or more thousands of armed men. Although the Roman state was still small, yet such great courage was in military affairs.

(2) When they had set out against the Gauls under the leadership of L. Furius, a certain one of the Gauls challenged one of the Romans, who was the best.

(3) Then M. Valerius, a military tribune, offered himself, and when he had gone forward armed, a raven sat on his right arm.

(4) Soon, having begun the battle against the Gaul, the same raven beat the eyes of the Gaul with its wings and claws, so that he could not look straight. Thus he was killed by the tribune Valerius. He gave not only victory to him, but also a name: for afterwards he was called Corvinus. And because of this merit he was made consul at the age of twenty-three.

### Chapter 7: Latin War, 340 – 338 BCE 

(1) The Latins, who did not want to give soldiers, also began to demand this from the Romans, that one consul be created from their people, the other from the Roman people.

(2) When this was denied, war was undertaken against them and they were defeated in a huge battle; and triumph was celebrated over these thoroughly subdued ones. Statues were placed on the rostra for the consuls because of the merit of the victory.

(3) In that year also Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great.

### Chapter 8: Second Samnite War, 36 – 304 BCE 

(1) Now the Romans began to be powerful. For war was being waged in the hundred and thirtieth mile from the city with the Samnites, who are in the middle between Picenum, Campania and Apulia.

(2) L. Papirius Cursor with the honor of dictator set out for that war. When he returned to Rome, he ordered Q. Fabius Maximus, the master of the horse, whom he had left with the army, not to fight while he was absent.

(3) He, having found an opportunity, fought most successfully and destroyed the Samnites. For this reason, having been condemned to death by the dictator, because he had fought while he forbade it, he was freed by the great favor of the soldiers and the people, with such a sedition stirred up by Papirius, that he himself was almost killed.

### Chapter 9: Romans Defeated at Caudine Forks, 321 BCE 

 (1) Afterwards the Samnites defeated the Romans with great disgrace under the consuls T. Veturius and Sp. Postumius and sent them under the yoke. However, the peace was dissolved by the senate and the people, which had been made with them out of necessity. Afterwards the Samnites were defeated by L. Papirius the consul, seven thousand of them were sent under the yoke. Papirius was the first to triumph over the Samnites.

(2) At that time Ap. Claudius the censor brought in the Claudia water and paved the Appian way. The Samnites, having renewed the war, defeated Q. Fabius Maximus with three thousand men killed. Afterwards, when his father Fabius Maximus had been his legate, he both defeated the Samnites and captured many of their towns.

(3) Then P. Cornelius Rufinus M. Curius Dentatus, both consuls, having been sent against the Samnites, defeated them in huge battles.

(4) Then they ended the war with the Samnites, which had been waged for forty-nine years: nor was there any enemy within Italy, who had more fatigued Roman courage.

### Chapter 10: War with the Gauls and Etruscans, 283 BCE 

After a few years had passed, again the forces of the Gauls joined themselves against the Romans with the Tuscans and Samnites, but when they were heading for Rome, they were destroyed by Cn. Cornelius Dolabella the consul.

### Chapter 11: War with Tarentum and Pyrrhus, 281 – 272 BCE. Battle of Heraclea, 280 BCE 

(1) At the same time war was declared on the Tarentines, who are now in the farthest part of Italy, because they had done an injury to the ambassadors of the Romans. They asked Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, for help against the Romans, who traced his origin from the race of Achilles. He soon came to Italy; then for the first time the Romans fought with a foreign enemy.

(2) A consul, P. Valerius Laevinus, was sent against him. When he had captured the scouts of Pyrrhus, he ordered them to be led through the camp, to show all the army and then to be dismissed, so that they might report to Pyrrhus whatever the Romans were doing. Soon, having begun the battle, when Pyrrhus was already fleeing, he won with the help of the elephants, which the Romans, not knowing them, had feared.

(3) But night put an end to the battle; however, Laevinus fled during the night, Pyrrhus captured eighteen hundred Romans and treated them with the highest honor, buried the dead. When he had seen them lying dead with a wound in front and a fierce expression, even though they were dead, he is said to have raised his hands to heaven with this voice: that he could have been the master of the whole world, if such soldiers had fallen to him.

### Chapter 12: Embassy of Cineas 

(1) Afterwards Pyrrhus, having joined the Samnites, Lucanians, Bruttians to himself, went to Rome, devastated everything with sword and fire, ravaged Campania and came to Praeneste, the eighteenth mile from the city.

(2) Soon, from the fear of the army, which was following him with the consul, he retreated into Campania. Ambassadors were sent to Pyrrhus about ransoming the captives, they were received honorably by him, he sent the captives to Rome without a price.

(3) He admired one of the ambassadors of the Romans, Fabricius, so much, when he had learned that he was poor, that he wished to tempt him with a quarter of the kingdom promised, so that he would cross over to him; he was despised by Fabricius.

(4) Therefore, since Pyrrhus was held in great admiration by the Romans, he sent an ambassador, who would seek peace on equal terms, a very important man, Cineas by name, so that Pyrrhus would retain part of Italy, which he had already occupied by arms.

### Chapter 13 

(1) Peace was not pleasing: Pyrrhus was ordered by the Senate that he could not have peace with the Romans unless he had left Italy.

(2) Then the Romans ordered all the captives, whom Pyrrhus had returned, to be infamous, because they could have been captured armed, and not before they returned to their old state, unless they had brought back the spoils of two slain enemies. Thus the legate of Pyrrhus returned.

(3) From whom when Pyrrhus asked what kind of Rome he had found, Cineas said he had seen the homeland of kings; evidently almost all there are such as Pyrrhus alone was thought to be in Epirus and the rest of Greece.

(4) Leaders P. Sulpicius and Decius Mus were sent against Pyrrhus. When the battle was joined, Pyrrhus was wounded, elephants were killed, twenty thousand of the enemy were killed and only five thousand of the Romans; Pyrrhus was driven to Tarentum.

### Chapter 14: Fabricius; Battle of Beneventum, 275 BCE 

(1) After a year had passed, Fabricius was sent against Pyrrhus, who had previously been unable to be solicited among the ambassadors with a quarter of the kingdom promised.

(2) Then, when he and the king had neighboring camps, Pyrrhus' doctor came to him at night, promising that he would kill Pyrrhus with poison if he promised him something. Whom Fabricius ordered to be led back bound to his master and to tell Pyrrhus what the doctor had pledged against his head. Then the king is said to have admired him:

(3) “That is Fabricius, who can be turned from honesty more difficultly than the sun from its course.” Then the king went to Sicily. Fabricius triumphed over the defeated Lucanians and Samnites.

(4) Then consuls M. Curius Dentatus and Cornelius Lentulus were sent against Pyrrhus. Curius fought against him, defeated his army, drove him to Tarentum, captured the camp.

(5) On that day twenty-three thousand of the enemy were killed. Curius triumphed in his consulship. He first led four elephants to Rome. Pyrrhus also soon left Tarentum and was killed at Argos, a city of Greece.

### Chapter 15 

In the consulship of C. Fabius Licinius and C. Claudius Canina, in the four hundred and sixty-first year from the founding of the city, Alexandrian ambassadors sent by Ptolemy came to Rome and obtained the friendship they had sought from the Romans.

### Chapter 16 

In the consulship of Q. Ogulnius and C. Fabius Pictor, the Picentes started a war and were defeated by the following consuls P. Sempronius and Ap. Claudius and a triumph was held over them. The cities of Ariminus in Gaul and Beneventum in Samnium were founded by the Romans.

### Chapter 17 

In the consulship of M. Atilius Regulus and L. Julius Libo, war was declared on the Salentines in Apulia and they were captured along with the city of Brundisium and a triumph was held over them.

### Chapter 18: First Punic War, 264 BCE – 241 BCE; Romans Victorious in Sicily, 264 BCE 

(1) In the four hundred and seventy-seventh year, when the name of the city of Rome was already famous, however, arms had not been moved outside Italy.

(2) Therefore, in order to find out what the forces of the Romans were, a census was held. Two hundred and ninety-two thousand three hundred and thirty-four citizens were found, although since the city was founded, wars had never ceased. And the first war was undertaken against the Africans in the consulship of Ap. Claudius and Q. Fulvius. They fought against them in Sicily and Ap. Claudius triumphed over the Africans and King Hiero of Sicily.

### Chapter 19 

(1) In the following year, in the consulship of Valerius Marcus and Otacilius [Crassus], great things were done by the Romans in Sicily. The Tauromenitans, the Catinaeans and moreover fifty cities were accepted in good faith.

(2) In the third year, war was prepared in Sicily against Hiero, king of the Sicilians. With all the nobility of the Syracusans, he obtained peace from the Romans and gave two hundred talents of silver.

(3) The Africans in Sicily were defeated and a second triumph was held in Rome over them.

### Chapter 20: Battle of Mylae, 260 BCE 

(1) In the fifth year of the Punic war, which was being waged against the Africans, the Romans first fought at sea in the consulship of C. Duilius and C. Cornelius Asina with prepared beaked ships, which they call Liburnians.

(2) Consul Cornelius was deceived by a trick. Duilius, having joined battle, defeated the Carthaginian leader, captured thirty-one ships, sank fourteen, captured seven thousand of the enemy, killed three thousand. No victory was more pleasing to the Romans, because, undefeated on land, now they also had the most power at sea.

(3) In the consulship of C. Aquilius Florus and L. Scipio, Scipio devastated Corsica and Sardinia, brought back many thousands of captives from there, held a triumph.

### Chapter 21: Invasion of Africa by the Romans, 256 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus, the war was transferred to Africa. He fought against Hamilcar, the Carthaginian leader, at sea and was defeated. For having lost sixty-four ships, he retreated. The Romans lost twenty-two.

(2) But when they had crossed into Africa, they first accepted the city of Clypea in Africa into surrender. The consuls proceeded as far as Carthage, and having devastated many places, Manlius returned victorious to Rome and brought back twenty-seven thousand captives, Atilius Regulus remained in Africa. He drew up a line of battle against the Africans.

(3) Having fought against three Carthaginian leaders, he was victorious, eighteen thousand of the enemy fell, five thousand with eighteen elephants were captured, seventy-four cities were accepted into good faith.

(4) Then the defeated Carthaginians sought peace from the Romans. When Regulus was unwilling to give peace except on the harshest conditions, the Africans sought help from the Lacedaemonians. And under the leadership of Xanthippus, who had been sent by the Lacedaemonians, the Roman leader Regulus was defeated with the utmost destruction.

(5) For only two thousand men from the entire Roman army escaped, five hundred with the commander Regulus were captured, thirty thousand were killed, Regulus himself was thrown into chains.

### Chapter 22: Romans Shipwrecked Near Sicily 

(1) In the consulship of M. Aemilius Paulus and Ser. Fulvius Nobilior, both Roman consuls set out for Africa with a fleet of three hundred ships. First they overcame the Africans in a naval battle.

(2) Aemilius the consul sank one hundred and four enemy ships, captured thirty with the fighters, either killed or captured fifteen thousand of the enemy, enriched his soldier with a huge booty. And Africa would have been subdued then, unless there was such a great famine that the army could not wait any longer.

(3) The consuls, returning with the victorious fleet, suffered shipwreck around Sicily and there was such a storm that out of four hundred and sixty-four ships, eighty could be saved; and at no time was such a maritime storm heard of. However, the Romans immediately repaired two hundred ships and their spirit was not broken in any way.

### Chapter 23 

(1) In the consulship of Cn. Servilius Caepio and C. Sempronius Blaesus, they set out for Africa with two hundred and sixty ships. They captured several cities.

(2) Bringing back a huge booty, they suffered shipwreck. Therefore, since continuous disasters were displeasing to the Romans, the Senate decreed that they should withdraw from naval battles and only sixty ships should be safe for the protection of Italy.

### Chapter 24: Battle of Panormus, 250 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of L. Caecilius Metellus and C. Furius Placidus, Metellus in Sicily overcame the African leader coming with 130 elephants and large forces, twenty thousand of the enemy were killed, twenty-six elephants were captured, the rest wandering through the Numidians, whom he had for help, he collected and led to Rome with a huge procession, when the number of 130 elephants filled all the roads.

Regulus Sent to Rome to Solicit Peace, 250 BCE 

(2) After these disasters, the Carthaginians asked for the leader Regulus, whom they had captured, to go to Rome and obtain peace from the Romans and make an exchange of captives.

### Chapter 25 

(1) When he had come to Rome, he was led into the Senate and did nothing as if he were a Roman and said that he had ceased to be a Roman from that day, when he had come into the power of the Africans.

(2) Therefore, he also removed his wife from his embrace and advised the Senate not to make peace with the Carthaginians. For they, broken by so many disasters, have no hope; it is not worth it, that so many thousands of captives should be returned for one old man and a few who had been captured from the Romans. And so he prevailed. For no one admitted the Africans seeking peace.

(3) He himself returned to Carthage, and when the Romans offered to keep him in Rome, he denied that he would stay in that city, in which, after he had served the Africans, he could not have the dignity of an honest citizen. Therefore, having returned to Africa, he was killed with all tortures.

### Chapter 26: Publius Claudius Defeated Near Drepana, 249 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of P. Claudius Pulcher and L. Junius, Claudius fought against the auspices and was defeated by the Carthaginians. For out of two hundred and twenty ships, he fled with thirty, ninety were captured with the fighters, the rest were sunk.

(2) Another consul also lost his fleet by shipwreck, however, he kept his army safe, because the shores were nearby.

### Chapter 27: Battle of Lilybaeum, 242 BCE. Battle of the Aegates Islands and End of the War, 241 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of C. Lutatius Catulus and A. Postumius Albinus, in the twenty-third year of the Punic war, Catulus waged war against the Africans. He set out with three hundred ships to Sicily; the Africans prepared four hundred against him.

(2) Never was a battle fought at sea with such large forces. Lutatius Catulus, sick, boarded the ship; for he had been wounded in the previous battle. A battle was fought against the city of Lilybaeum in Sicily with the great courage of the Romans.

(3) For sixty-three Carthaginian ships were captured, one hundred and twenty-five were sunk, thirty-two thousand of the enemy were captured, thirteen thousand were killed, an infinite amount of gold, silver, booty was brought under the power of the Romans. From the Roman fleet, twelve ships were sunk. The battle was fought on the sixth day before the Ides of March.

(4) Immediately the Carthaginians sought peace and peace was granted to them. The Roman captives, who were being held by the Carthaginians, were returned. The Carthaginians also asked that they be allowed to ransom those captives, whom the Romans were holding from the Africans. The Senate ordered that they be given without price, who were in public custody; but those who were held by private individuals, that they should return to Carthage with the price returned to the masters and that this price should be paid from the treasury rather than by the Carthaginians.

### Chapter 28 

Q. Lutatius and A. Manlius were created consuls. They waged war on the Faliscans, which was once a wealthy city of Italy. Both consuls, within six days from when they had come, carried it out with fifteen thousand of the enemy killed, the rest having been granted peace, however, the land was taken away from half of them.

## Book 3: From the End of the First to the End of the Second Punic War, 241 – 201 BCE 

### Chapter 1 

(1) Therefore, with the Punic war finished, which was drawn out over 23 years, the Romans, now known for their most illustrious glory, sent ambassadors to Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, promising aid, because the king of Syria, Antiochus, had waged war against him. He thanked the Romans, but did not accept aid from the Romans. For the battle had already been fought.

(2) At the same time, Hiero, the most powerful king of Sicily, came to Rome to watch the games and presented the people with a gift of two hundred thousand pecks of wheat.

### Chapter 2: Sardinia Taken by the Romans, 237 BCE 

In the consulship of L. Cornelius Lentulus and Fulvius Flaccus, to whom Hiero had come to Rome, war was also waged against the Ligures within Italy and triumphed over them. However, the Carthaginians were attempting to repair the war, inciting the Sardinians, who ought to have obeyed the Romans according to the terms of the peace, to rebel. However, a delegation of Carthaginians came to Rome and obtained peace.

### Chapter 3 

In the consulship of T. Manlius Torquatus and C. Atilius Bulbus, triumph was had over the Sardi and with peace made in all places, the Romans had no war, which had happened to them only once after Rome was founded, during the reign of Numa Pompilius.

### Chapter 4: War with the Illyrians, 229 BCE 

The consuls L. Postumius Albinus and Cn. Fulvius Centumalus waged war against the Illyrians and having captured many cities, they also accepted kings into surrender. And then for the first time, triumph was had over the Illyrians.

### Chapter 5: Invasion of the Gauls, 225 BCE 

In the consulship of L. Aemilius, huge forces of Gauls crossed the Alps. But all of Italy agreed for the Romans and it was handed down by Fabius the historian, who was present at that war, that eight hundred thousand men were prepared for that war. But the matter was carried out prosperously only by the consul. Forty thousand of the enemy were killed and a triumph was decreed for Aemilius.

### Chapter 6 

(1) Then, after several years, war was waged against the Gauls within Italy and the war was ended in the consulship of M. Claudius Marcellus and Cn. Cornelius Scipio. Then Marcellus fought with a small band of horsemen and killed the king of the Gauls, named Viridomarus, with his own hand.

(2) Afterwards, with his colleague, he killed huge forces of Gauls, stormed Mediolanum, brought great booty to Rome. And triumphing, Marcellus carried the spoils of the Gaul, placed on a pole, on his shoulders.

### Chapter 7: Second Punic War Begun, 218 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of M. Minucius Rufus and P. Cornelius, war was brought upon the Histri, because they had been robbing the ships of the Romans, which were bringing grain; and all were thoroughly subdued.

(2) In the same year, the second Punic war was brought upon the Romans by Hannibal, the leader of the Carthaginians: who, being twenty years old, having gathered forces of one hundred and fifty thousand, began to besiege Saguntum, a city of Spain, friendly to the Romans.

(3) To him, the Romans sent legates to denounce him, that he should abstain from war. He did not want to admit the legates. The Romans also sent [legates] to Carthage, that it should be ordered to Hannibal, not to wage war against the allies of the Roman people. Harsh responses were given by the Carthaginians. Meanwhile, the Saguntines were conquered by famine and those captured by Hannibal were afflicted with the worst punishments.

### Chapter 8: Hannibal Crosses the Alps  

(1) Then P. Cornelius Scipio set out with an army to Spain, Ti. Sempronius [set out] to Sicily. War was declared on the Carthaginians.

(2) Hannibal, having left his brother Hasdrubal in Spain, crossed the Pyrenees. He opened up the Alps, which were still impassable on that side. It is handed down that he brought eighty thousand foot soldiers, ten thousand horsemen, and thirty-seven elephants to Italy. Meanwhile, many Ligures and Gauls joined Hannibal. Sempronius Gracchus, having learned of Hannibal's arrival to Italy, transferred his army from Sicily to Ariminum.

### Chapter 9: Battle of Trebia, 218 BCE; Battle of Lake Trasumenus, 217 BCE 

(1) P. Cornelius Scipio was the first to meet Hannibal. Having engaged in battle, he was put to flight by his own [men] and he himself, having been wounded, returned to the camp. Sempronius Gracchus also engaged [in battle] at the river Trebia; he too was defeated. Many in Italy surrendered to Hannibal.

(2) Then, coming to Tuscany, Hannibal met the consul Flaminius. He killed Flaminius himself; twenty-five thousand Romans were killed, the rest fled. Q. Fabius Maximus was sent against Hannibal afterwards by the Romans. He broke him by delaying the battle, soon, having found an opportunity, he conquered.

### Chapter 10: Battle of Cannae, 216 BCE 

(1) In the five hundred and fortieth year from the founding of the city, L. Aemilius Paulus and P. Terentius Varro were sent against Hannibal and they succeeded Fabius, who, departing, warned both consuls, that they would defeat Hannibal, a cunning and impatient leader, in no other way than by delaying the battle.

(2) But with the impatience of the consul Varro, the other consul [that is Aemilius Paulus] disagreeing, when a battle had been fought at a village, which is called Cannae, in Apulia, both consuls were defeated by Hannibal.

(3) In that battle, three thousand Africans perished; a great part of Hannibal's army was wounded. However, in no Punic war were the Romans more heavily defeated; for in it the consul Aemilius Paulus perished, twenty consulars or praetorians [perished], thirty senators were captured or killed, three hundred noble men, forty thousand soldiers, three thousand and five hundred horsemen. In these evils, however, no one of the Romans deigned to mention peace. Slaves, which never before, were manumitted and made soldiers.

### Chapter 11: War in Spain, 218 BCE 

(1) After that battle, many cities of Italy, which had obeyed the Romans, transferred themselves to Hannibal. Hannibal offered to the Romans, that they ransom the captives, and a response was given by the Senate that those citizens were not necessary, who, although they were armed, could have been captured. He afterwards killed all with various punishments and sent three pecks of gold rings to Carthage, which he had taken off the hands of the Roman horsemen, senators and soldiers.

(2) Meanwhile, in Spain, where the brother of Hannibal, Hasdrubal, had remained with a large army, in order to subdue all of it to the Africans, he is defeated by two Scipios, Roman leaders. He loses in the battle thirty-five thousand men; of these, ten thousand are captured, twenty-five thousand are killed. Twelve thousand foot soldiers, four thousand horsemen, twenty elephants are sent to him by the Carthaginians to repair his forces.

### Chapter 12: Battle Near Nola, 215 BCE 

(1) In the fourth year, after Hannibal had come to Italy, M. Claudius Marcellus, the consul, fought well against Hannibal near the city of Nola in Campania. Hannibal occupied many cities of the Romans throughout Apulia, Calabria, and the Bruttii.

(2) At which time also the king of Macedonia, Philip, sent legates to him promising aid against the Romans under this condition, that, with the Romans destroyed, he himself also would receive aid against the Greeks from Hannibal.

(3) Therefore, with the legates of Philip captured and the matter known, the Romans ordered M. Valerius Laevinus to go to Macedonia, T. Manlius Torquatus the proconsul to Sardinia. For even that [place], having been incited by Hannibal, had deserted the Romans.

Here is the translation:

### Chapter 13

(1) Thus, at one time, battles were being fought in four places: in Italy against Hannibal, in Spain against his brother Hasdrubal, in Macedonia against Philip, and in Sardinia against the Sardinians and another Hasdrubal of Carthage.

(2) He was captured alive by T. Manlius, the proconsul, who had been sent to Sardinia, twelve thousand were killed with him, fifteen hundred were captured, and Sardinia was subdued by the Romans. Manlius, the victor, brought the captives and Hasdrubal back to Rome.

(3) Meanwhile, Philip is also defeated by Laevinus in Macedonia and in Spain by the Scipios, Hasdrubal and Mago, the third brother of Hannibal.

### Chapter 14: Campaign in Sicily, 214 – 210 BCE

(1) In the tenth year, after Hannibal had come to Italy, P. Sulpicius and Cn. Fulvius being consuls, Hannibal came as far as four miles from the city, his cavalry even up to the gate. Soon, fearing the arrival of the consuls with their army, Hannibal retreated to Campania.

(2) In Spain, both Scipios, who had been victorious for many years, were killed by Hasdrubal's brother, but the army remained intact; for they were deceived more by chance than by virtue.

(3) At this time also, a large part of Sicily was captured by the consul Marcellus, which the Africans had begun to hold, and the most noble city of Syracuse; a huge booty was brought to Rome.

(4) Laevinus in Macedonia made friendship with Philip and many peoples of Greece and Attalus, the king of Asia, and having gone to Sicily, he captured a certain Hanno, a leader of the Africans, at the city of Agrigentum along with the town itself; and he sent him to Rome with noble captives. He received forty cities into surrender, he stormed twenty-six. Thus, with all of Sicily recovered and Macedonia broken, he returned to Rome with great glory. Hannibal in Italy suddenly attacked Cn. Fulvius the consul and killed eight thousand men.

### Chapter 15: War in Spain, 210 – 206 CBE

(1) Meanwhile, to Spain, where two Scipios had been killed and there was no Roman leader, P. Cornelius Scipio is sent, the son of P. Scipio, who had waged war there, a man almost the first of all Romans both in his own age and in later time, aged twenty-four.

(2) He captures Carthage in Spain, in which the Africans had all their gold, silver and war equipment, also the most noble hostages, which they had received from the Spaniards.

(3) He also captures Mago, the brother of Hannibal, there, whom he sends to Rome with others. In Rome, there was great joy after this news. Scipio returned the Spanish hostages to their parents; wherefore almost all of Spain with one mind went over to him. After which he defeats Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, put to flight and captures a very large booty.

### Chapter 16: Recapture of Tarentum, 209 BCE

(1) Meanwhile in Italy, the consul Q. Fabius Maximus recaptured Tarentum, in which there were huge forces of Hannibal. There he also killed Carthalo, a leader of Hannibal, he sold twenty-five thousand men as captives, he distributed the booty among the soldiers, he brought the money of the men sold to the treasury. Then many cities of the Romans, which had previously gone over to Hannibal, again surrendered themselves to Fabius Maximus.

(2) In the following year, Scipio did great things in Spain both by himself and through his brother L. Scipio; they recovered seventy cities. However, in Italy the battle went badly. For the consul Claudius Marcellus was killed by Hannibal.

### Chapter 17

In the third year, after Scipio had set out for Spain, he again performs famous deeds. He received the king of Spain, defeated in a great battle, into friendship and was the first of all to not demand hostages from the defeated.

### Chapter 18: Battle of Metaurus, 207 BCE

(1) Despairing that Spain could be held against Scipio for any longer, Hannibal called his brother Hasdrubal to Italy with all his forces.

(2) Coming by the same route that Hannibal had also come, he fell into an ambush composed by the consuls AP. Claudius Nero and M. Livius Salinator at the city of Sena in Picenum. However, fighting strenuously, he was killed, his huge forces were captured or killed, a large weight of gold and silver was brought to Rome.

(3) After these things, Hannibal now began to distrust the outcome of the war. The Romans gained great courage; and so they themselves also called P. Cornelius Scipio from Spain. He came to Rome with great glory.

### Chapter 19

Q. Caecilius L. Valerius being consuls, all cities, which were held in Bruttium by Hannibal, surrendered themselves to the Romans.

### Chapter 20: Scipio Crosses into Africa, 204 BCE

(1) In the fourteenth year, after Hannibal had come to Italy, Scipio, who had done many good things in Spain, was made consul and sent to Africa. Something divine was thought to be in this man, so much so that it was thought that he even had conversation with the gods.

(2) He fights in Africa against Hanno, the leader of the Africans; he kills his army. In a second battle, he captures the camp with four thousand five hundred soldiers, eleven thousand killed. He captures Syphax, the king of Numidia, who had joined the Africans, and invades his camp. Syphax with the most noble Numidians and infinite spoils is sent to Rome by Scipio.

(3) When this thing was heard, almost all of Italy deserted Hannibal. He himself is ordered by the Carthaginians to return to Africa, which Scipio was devastating.

### Chapter 21: Efforts for Peace

(1) Thus, in the seventeenth year, Italy was freed from Hannibal. The Carthaginian envoys sought peace from Scipio.

(2) They were sent by him to the senate at Rome. Forty-five days of truce were given to them, so that they could go to Rome and return, and thirty thousand pounds of silver were received from them. The senate ordered peace to be made with the Carthaginians at the discretion of Scipio.

(3) Scipio gave them these conditions: that they should not have more than thirty ships, that they should give five hundred thousand pounds of silver, that they should return captives and deserters.

### Chapter 22

(1) Meanwhile, with Hannibal coming to Africa, peace was disturbed, many hostile things were done by the Africans.

(2) However, their envoys coming from the city were captured by the Romans, but were dismissed by the order of Scipio. Hannibal also, defeated by Scipio in frequent battles, himself also seeks peace. When it had come to a conference, it was given on the same conditions as before, with five hundred thousand pounds of silver added to a hundred thousand pounds because of the new treachery. The Carthaginians disliked the conditions and ordered Hannibal to fight. War is waged on Carthage by Scipio and Masinissa, another king of the Numidians, who had made friendship with Scipio.

(3) Hannibal sent three scouts to Scipio's camp, who, when captured, Scipio ordered to be led around through the camp and to show them the whole army, soon also to give them lunch and to dismiss them, so that they might report to Hannibal what they had seen among the Romans.

### Chapter 23: Battle of Zama, 202 BCE. End of the Second Punic War, 201 BCE

(1) Meanwhile, a battle was arranged by each leader, such as was hardly in any memory, when the most experienced men led their forces to war. Scipio, the victor, withdrew, almost capturing Hannibal himself, who first escaped with many cavalry, then with twenty, finally with four.

(2) Found in the camp of Hannibal were two hundred thousand pounds of silver, eighty of gold, the rest of the equipment was plentiful. After this contest, peace was made with the Carthaginians. Scipio returned to Rome, triumphed with great glory and began to be called Africanus from this.

(3) The second Punic war came to an end after the nineteenth year, when it had begun.
