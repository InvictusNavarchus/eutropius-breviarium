Certainly! Here's the translation of the Latin text:

# Preface

**To Lord Valens, the Eternal Augustus, Greatest of the Goths**

**Eutropius, Master of Memory**

I have compiled a brief narrative of Roman affairs from the founding of the city to our own time, highlighting events that stood out in matters of war and civil administration. Additionally, I have included remarkable deeds of illustrious men in their governance, so that your divine mind may rejoice in the accomplishments of those who administered the empire before you, even before reading.

## Book 1: From the Founding of Rome to the Capture of the City by the Gauls, 753 – 390 BCE. The Regal Period, 753 – 509 BCE 

### Chapter 1: Rome Founded, 753 BCE. Romulus, 753 – 716 BCE 

(1) The Roman Empire, which can scarcely be recalled from its very beginning or surpassed in its subsequent growth by human memory, traces its origin to Romulus. He was born of Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin, and, as is believed, of Mars. 

(2) While he was living among shepherds, at the age of eighteen, he founded the small city on the Palatine Hill. This occurred on the eleventh day before the Kalends of May, in the third year of the sixth Olympiad, after the fall of Troy, according to the most reliable accounts, in the four hundred and ninety-fourth year from the founding of the city.

### Chapter 2 

(1) After establishing the city, which he named Rome after himself, Romulus did the following: he admitted a multitude of neighboring people into the city, selected one hundred senators from the elderly, whose advice he followed, and appointed them senators due to their advanced age.

(2) Then, since neither he nor his people had wives, he invited the neighboring nations and the daughters of the Sabines to a spectacle of games. Stirred by the wars due to the outrage against the abducted women, he conquered the Caeninenses, Antemnates, Crustumini, Sabines, and Veientes. All these towns surround Rome. And when a sudden storm arose, he was believed to have been taken up to the gods in the thirty-seventh year of his reign and was consecrated. Afterward, for five days, the senators ruled in Rome, and during their reign, one year was completed.

### Chapter 3: Numa Pompilius, 715 – 672 BCE 

(1) Next, Numa Pompilius was chosen as king. Although he waged no wars, he benefited the state no less than Romulus.

(2) For he established laws and customs for the Romans, who were already considered half-barbarians due to their habit of fighting. He also divided the year into ten months without any precise calculation, and he instituted countless sacred rites and temples in Rome. He died in the forty-third year of his reign.

### Chapter 4: Tullus Hostilius, 672 – 640 BCE 

(1) Tullus Hostilius succeeded him. He renewed wars, defeated the Albans, who were twelve miles from Rome, and conquered the Veientes and Fidenates, some of whom were six miles away from Rome, while others were eighteen miles away. He expanded the city by adding the Caelian Hill.

(2) After reigning for thirty-two years, he was struck by lightning and consumed with his house.

### Chapter 5: Ancus Marcius, 640 – 616 BCE 

(1) Following him, Ancus Marcius, the grandson of Numa, assumed power.

(2) He engaged in conflict with the Latins. He added the Aventine Hill to the city and founded a city above the sea at the mouth of the Tiber River, sixteen miles from Rome. In the twenty-fourth year of his reign, he died of illness.

### Chapter 6: Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, 616 – 578 BCE 

(1) Then Priscus Tarquinius took the throne. He doubled the number of senators, built structures around Rome, and established Roman games that endure in our memory. He also conquered the Sabines and added considerable territory to the city of Rome. As the first triumphant leader, he entered the city.

(2) He constructed walls and sewers and began the construction of the Capitoline Hill. In the thirty-eighth year of his reign, he was killed by the sons of Ancus, the king he had succeeded.

### Chapter 7: Servius Tullius, 578 – 534 BCE 

(1) After this, Servius Tullius assumed power. He was born of a noble woman but was a captive and a slave. He also subdued the Sabines and added three hills—Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline—to the city. He constructed ditches around the walls. He was the first to establish a census, which until then was unknown throughout the world.

(2) During his reign, Rome had a census of eighty-three thousand Roman citizens, including those in the countryside. He was killed by the treachery of his son-in-law, Tarquin the Proud, the son of the former king, along with his daughter, whom Tarquin had married.

### Chapter 8: Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, 534 – 510 BCE 

(1) L. Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last of the kings, defeated the Volsci, a tribe not far from Rome as one travels toward Campania. He conquered the cities of Gabii and Suessa Pometia, made peace with the Etruscans, and built a temple to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. Later, while besieging Ardea, a city located sixteen miles from Rome, he lost his power.

(2) The cause of his downfall was the infamous act committed by his son, Tarquin the Younger. Tarquin violated the most noble woman, Lucretia, who was also the most chaste. She complained of the injustice to her husband, father, and friends, and in the presence of all, she took her own life. For this reason, Brutus, who was also a relative of Tarquin, incited the people and removed Tarquin from power.

(3) Soon, even the army that was besieging the city of Ardea with the king abandoned him. Tarquin, with his wife and children, fled after reigning for twenty-four years. Thus, Rome was ruled by seven kings for two hundred and forty-three years, during which time Rome possessed only a small territory, barely reaching fifteen miles.

### Chapter 9: Establishment of the Republic. Election of Consuls, 509 BCE 

(1) From this point, the consulship began. Two consuls were chosen instead of one king, with the purpose that if one turned out to be wicked, the other, having similar authority, could restrain him.

(2) It was also decided that they should not hold power for more than a year, so that prolonged authority would not make them insolent, and they would always remain citizens who knew that they would return to private life after a year.

(3) In the first year after the expulsion of the kings, the consuls were Lucius Junius Brutus, who had worked tirelessly to drive out Tarquin, and Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia.

(4) However, Collatinus was immediately stripped of his dignity. It had been agreed that no one bearing the name Tarquin should remain in the city. Therefore, Collatinus left the city, taking all his possessions with him, and Lucius Valerius Publicola was appointed consul in his place.

War with Tarquinius 

(5) Nevertheless, Tarquin, the deposed king, stirred up war against Rome. He gathered many nations to restore him to power.

### Chapter 11: War with Porsenna, 508 BCE 

(1) In the second year, Tarquin once again waged war against the Romans, seeking to be restored to power. Porsenna, the king of Etruria, provided him with assistance, and they nearly captured Rome. However, Tarquin was defeated once more.

(2) In the third year after the expulsion of the kings, Tarquin, unable to regain the throne and with Porsenna no longer supporting him, retreated to Tusculum—a city not far from Rome—where he lived in exile with his wife for fourteen years.

(3) In the fourth year after the expulsion of the kings, the Romans waged war against the Sabines and emerged victorious, resulting in a triumph.

(4) In the fifth year, Lucius Valerius, the colleague of Brutus and a four-time consul, met a tragic end. He was so impoverished that the people collected money for his burial. Like Brutus, he was mourned by the Roman matrons.

### Chapter 12: Institution of the Dictatorship, 501 BCE 

(1) In the ninth year after the expulsion of the kings, when Tarquin's son-in-law raised a large army to avenge an injury, a new office was created in Rome called the dictatorship. This office held greater authority than the consulship. In the same year, the position of master of horse (magister equitum) was established to assist the dictator.

(2) There is nothing more similar to this ancient dictatorship than the power your Tranquillitas Vestra holds today. Even Augustus Octavian, whom we will discuss later, and before him, Gaius Caesar, ruled under the name and honor of the dictatorship.

(3) The first dictator in Rome was T. Larcius, and the first master of horse was Sp. Cassius.

### Chapter 13: Secession of the Plebeians. Establishment of the Tribunate, 494 BCE 

(1) In the sixteenth year after the expulsion of the kings, the Roman populace rebelled, feeling oppressed by the Senate and consuls.

(2) At that time, they also created the office of tribunes of the plebs, who acted as their own judges and defenders against the Senate and consuls.

### Chapter 14: War with the Volsci, 493 BCE 

In the following year, the Volsci renewed their war against the Romans. They were defeated in battle, and the city of Corioli, which they had held, was lost.

### Chapter 15: Coriolanus, 491 BCE 

(1) In the eighteenth year after the expulsion of the kings, Quintus Marcius, a Roman general who had captured the Volscian city of Corioli, turned his anger against the Romans themselves and sought aid from the Volsci.

(2) He often defeated the Romans and even advanced to within five miles of the city, intending to attack his own homeland. However, when envoys seeking peace were rejected, his mother Veturia and wife Volumnia came from Rome. Overwhelmed by their tears and pleas, he withdrew his army. Coriolanus became the second leader, after Tarquin, to fight against his own country.

### Chapter 16: Slaughter of the Fabii, 477 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of C. Fabius and L. Virginius, three hundred noble men from the Fabian family undertook war against the Veientes alone, promising to fill the Senate and the people with their own efforts.

(2) Setting out, all these nobles, who individually should have been leaders of great armies, fell in battle.

(3) Only one survived from such a renowned family, who, due to his young age, could not be led into battle. Afterward, a census was held in the city, and they found one hundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and nineteen citizens.

### Chapter 17: Dictatorship of Cincinnatus, 458 BCE 

(1) In the following year, when the Roman army was besieged by the enemy on Mount Algidus, L. Quintius Cincinnatus was appointed dictator. He was cultivating a four-acre field with his own hands.

(2) When he was found working in the field and plowing, he wiped the sweat from his brow, put on his toga praetexta, and, after defeating the enemy in battle, liberated the army.

### Chapter 18: Decemvirs Appointed, 451 BCE. Laws of XII Tables Promulgated, 450 BCE. Death of Virginia; Decemvirs Deposed, 449 BCE 

 (1) In the three hundred and fifty-first year after the founding of the city, the consular government ceased, and ten men were appointed instead of two consuls. These ten men, called decemvirs, held supreme power.

(2) However, in the first year, they governed well. In the second year, one of them, Ap. Claudius, attempted to corrupt the daughter of a certain Virginius, who was serving honorably against the Latins on Mount Algidus. Her father killed her to prevent her from enduring dishonor from the decemvir. In response, the soldiers revolted. The decemvirs were stripped of their power and condemned.

### Chapter 19: Revolt of the Fidenates, 438 BCE 

(1) In the three hundred and fifty-fifth year after the founding of the city, the Fidenates rebelled against the Romans. The Veiens and King Tolumnius supported them.

(2) Both these cities are so close to Rome that Fidenae is six miles away, and Veii is eighteen miles away. They joined forces with the Volsci. However, under the dictatorship of Mam. Aemilius and the leadership of L. Quintius Cincinnatus, the Romans defeated them and even captured the king.

### Chapter 20: War with Veii, 396 BCE 

(1) After twenty years, the Veientani rebelled once again. Dictator Furius Camillus was sent against them. He first defeated them in battle and then, after a long siege, captured their city, the most ancient and wealthiest in Italy.

(2) Afterward, he also captured the city of the Falisci, which was no less renowned. However, he incurred envy due to the perception that he had unfairly divided the spoils. As a result, he was condemned and exiled from the city.

Rome Captured by the Gauls, 390 BCE 

(3) Immediately, the Senonian Gauls came to the city and, after defeating the Romans at the eleventh milestone from Rome near the river Allia, they occupied the city. Nothing could be defended except the Capitoline Hill. After a long siege and with the Romans suffering from hunger, Camillus arrived and decisively defeated the Gauls.

(4) Later, even after receiving gold to prevent the siege of the Capitoline Hill, the Gauls withdrew. Camillus pursued them and recovered both the gold given to them and all the military standards they had captured.

(5) Thus, triumphantly, he entered the city for the third time and was hailed as the second Romulus, as if he himself were the founder of the nation.
