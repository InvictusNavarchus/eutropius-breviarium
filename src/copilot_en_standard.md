# Preface

**To Lord Valens, the Eternal Augustus, Greatest of the Goths**

**Eutropius, Master of Memory**

I have compiled a brief narrative of Roman affairs from the founding of the city to our own time, highlighting events that stood out in matters of war and civil administration. Additionally, I have included remarkable deeds of illustrious men in their governance, so that your divine mind may rejoice in the accomplishments of those who administered the empire before you, even before reading.

## Book 1: From the Founding of Rome to the Capture of the City by the Gauls, 753 – 390 BCE. The Regal Period, 753 – 509 BCE 

### Chapter 1: Rome Founded, 753 BCE. Romulus, 753 – 716 BCE 

(1) The Roman Empire, which can scarcely be recalled from its very beginning or surpassed in its subsequent growth by human memory, traces its origin to Romulus. He was born of Rhea Silvia, a Vestal Virgin, and, as is believed, of Mars. 

(2) While he was living among shepherds, at the age of eighteen, he founded the small city on the Palatine Hill. This occurred on the eleventh day before the Kalends of May, in the third year of the sixth Olympiad, after the fall of Troy, according to the most reliable accounts, in the four hundred and ninety-fourth year from the founding of the city.

### Chapter 2 

(1) After establishing the city, which he named Rome after himself, Romulus did the following: he admitted a multitude of neighboring people into the city, selected one hundred senators from the elderly, whose advice he followed, and appointed them senators due to their advanced age.

(2) Then, since neither he nor his people had wives, he invited the neighboring nations and the daughters of the Sabines to a spectacle of games. Stirred by the wars due to the outrage against the abducted women, he conquered the Caeninenses, Antemnates, Crustumini, Sabines, and Veientes. All these towns surround Rome. And when a sudden storm arose, he was believed to have been taken up to the gods in the thirty-seventh year of his reign and was consecrated. Afterward, for five days, the senators ruled in Rome, and during their reign, one year was completed.

### Chapter 3: Numa Pompilius, 715 – 672 BCE 

(1) Next, Numa Pompilius was chosen as king. Although he waged no wars, he benefited the state no less than Romulus.

(2) For he established laws and customs for the Romans, who were already considered half-barbarians due to their habit of fighting. He also divided the year into ten months without any precise calculation, and he instituted countless sacred rites and temples in Rome. He died in the forty-third year of his reign.

### Chapter 4: Tullus Hostilius, 672 – 640 BCE 

(1) Tullus Hostilius succeeded him. He renewed wars, defeated the Albans, who were twelve miles from Rome, and conquered the Veientes and Fidenates, some of whom were six miles away from Rome, while others were eighteen miles away. He expanded the city by adding the Caelian Hill.

(2) After reigning for thirty-two years, he was struck by lightning and consumed with his house.

### Chapter 5: Ancus Marcius, 640 – 616 BCE 

(1) Following him, Ancus Marcius, the grandson of Numa, assumed power.

(2) He engaged in conflict with the Latins. He added the Aventine Hill to the city and founded a city above the sea at the mouth of the Tiber River, sixteen miles from Rome. In the twenty-fourth year of his reign, he died of illness.

### Chapter 6: Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, 616 – 578 BCE 

(1) Then Priscus Tarquinius took the throne. He doubled the number of senators, built structures around Rome, and established Roman games that endure in our memory. He also conquered the Sabines and added considerable territory to the city of Rome. As the first triumphant leader, he entered the city.

(2) He constructed walls and sewers and began the construction of the Capitoline Hill. In the thirty-eighth year of his reign, he was killed by the sons of Ancus, the king he had succeeded.

### Chapter 7: Servius Tullius, 578 – 534 BCE 

(1) After this, Servius Tullius assumed power. He was born of a noble woman but was a captive and a slave. He also subdued the Sabines and added three hills—Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline—to the city. He constructed ditches around the walls. He was the first to establish a census, which until then was unknown throughout the world.

(2) During his reign, Rome had a census of eighty-three thousand Roman citizens, including those in the countryside. He was killed by the treachery of his son-in-law, Tarquin the Proud, the son of the former king, along with his daughter, whom Tarquin had married.

### Chapter 8: Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, 534 – 510 BCE 

(1) L. Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last of the kings, defeated the Volsci, a tribe not far from Rome as one travels toward Campania. He conquered the cities of Gabii and Suessa Pometia, made peace with the Etruscans, and built a temple to Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. Later, while besieging Ardea, a city located sixteen miles from Rome, he lost his power.

(2) The cause of his downfall was the infamous act committed by his son, Tarquin the Younger. Tarquin violated the most noble woman, Lucretia, who was also the most chaste. She complained of the injustice to her husband, father, and friends, and in the presence of all, she took her own life. For this reason, Brutus, who was also a relative of Tarquin, incited the people and removed Tarquin from power.

(3) Soon, even the army that was besieging the city of Ardea with the king abandoned him. Tarquin, with his wife and children, fled after reigning for twenty-four years. Thus, Rome was ruled by seven kings for two hundred and forty-three years, during which time Rome possessed only a small territory, barely reaching fifteen miles.

### Chapter 9: Establishment of the Republic. Election of Consuls, 509 BCE 

(1) From this point, the consulship began. Two consuls were chosen instead of one king, with the purpose that if one turned out to be wicked, the other, having similar authority, could restrain him.

(2) It was also decided that they should not hold power for more than a year, so that prolonged authority would not make them insolent, and they would always remain citizens who knew that they would return to private life after a year.

(3) In the first year after the expulsion of the kings, the consuls were Lucius Junius Brutus, who had worked tirelessly to drive out Tarquin, and Tarquinius Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia.

(4) However, Collatinus was immediately stripped of his dignity. It had been agreed that no one bearing the name Tarquin should remain in the city. Therefore, Collatinus left the city, taking all his possessions with him, and Lucius Valerius Publicola was appointed consul in his place.

War with Tarquinius 

(5) Nevertheless, Tarquin, the deposed king, stirred up war against Rome. He gathered many nations to restore him to power.

### Chapter 11: War with Porsenna, 508 BCE 

(1) In the second year, Tarquin once again waged war against the Romans, seeking to be restored to power. Porsenna, the king of Etruria, provided him with assistance, and they nearly captured Rome. However, Tarquin was defeated once more.

(2) In the third year after the expulsion of the kings, Tarquin, unable to regain the throne and with Porsenna no longer supporting him, retreated to Tusculum—a city not far from Rome—where he lived in exile with his wife for fourteen years.

(3) In the fourth year after the expulsion of the kings, the Romans waged war against the Sabines and emerged victorious, resulting in a triumph.

(4) In the fifth year, Lucius Valerius, the colleague of Brutus and a four-time consul, met a tragic end. He was so impoverished that the people collected money for his burial. Like Brutus, he was mourned by the Roman matrons.

### Chapter 12: Institution of the Dictatorship, 501 BCE 

(1) In the ninth year after the expulsion of the kings, when Tarquin's son-in-law raised a large army to avenge an injury, a new office was created in Rome called the dictatorship. This office held greater authority than the consulship. In the same year, the position of master of horse (magister equitum) was established to assist the dictator.

(2) There is nothing more similar to this ancient dictatorship than the power your Tranquillitas Vestra holds today. Even Augustus Octavian, whom we will discuss later, and before him, Gaius Caesar, ruled under the name and honor of the dictatorship.

(3) The first dictator in Rome was T. Larcius, and the first master of horse was Sp. Cassius.

### Chapter 13: Secession of the Plebeians. Establishment of the Tribunate, 494 BCE 

(1) In the sixteenth year after the expulsion of the kings, the Roman populace rebelled, feeling oppressed by the Senate and consuls.

(2) At that time, they also created the office of tribunes of the plebs, who acted as their own judges and defenders against the Senate and consuls.

### Chapter 14: War with the Volsci, 493 BCE 

In the following year, the Volsci renewed their war against the Romans. They were defeated in battle, and the city of Corioli, which they had held, was lost.

### Chapter 15: Coriolanus, 491 BCE 

(1) In the eighteenth year after the expulsion of the kings, Quintus Marcius, a Roman general who had captured the Volscian city of Corioli, turned his anger against the Romans themselves and sought aid from the Volsci.

(2) He often defeated the Romans and even advanced to within five miles of the city, intending to attack his own homeland. However, when envoys seeking peace were rejected, his mother Veturia and wife Volumnia came from Rome. Overwhelmed by their tears and pleas, he withdrew his army. Coriolanus became the second leader, after Tarquin, to fight against his own country.

### Chapter 16: Slaughter of the Fabii, 477 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of C. Fabius and L. Virginius, three hundred noble men from the Fabian family undertook war against the Veientes alone, promising to fill the Senate and the people with their own efforts.

(2) Setting out, all these nobles, who individually should have been leaders of great armies, fell in battle.

(3) Only one survived from such a renowned family, who, due to his young age, could not be led into battle. Afterward, a census was held in the city, and they found one hundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and nineteen citizens.

### Chapter 17: Dictatorship of Cincinnatus, 458 BCE 

(1) In the following year, when the Roman army was besieged by the enemy on Mount Algidus, L. Quintius Cincinnatus was appointed dictator. He was cultivating a four-acre field with his own hands.

(2) When he was found working in the field and plowing, he wiped the sweat from his brow, put on his toga praetexta, and, after defeating the enemy in battle, liberated the army.

### Chapter 18: Decemvirs Appointed, 451 BCE. Laws of XII Tables Promulgated, 450 BCE. Death of Virginia; Decemvirs Deposed, 449 BCE 

 (1) In the three hundred and fifty-first year after the founding of the city, the consular government ceased, and ten men were appointed instead of two consuls. These ten men, called decemvirs, held supreme power.

(2) However, in the first year, they governed well. In the second year, one of them, Ap. Claudius, attempted to corrupt the daughter of a certain Virginius, who was serving honorably against the Latins on Mount Algidus. Her father killed her to prevent her from enduring dishonor from the decemvir. In response, the soldiers revolted. The decemvirs were stripped of their power and condemned.

### Chapter 19: Revolt of the Fidenates, 438 BCE 

(1) In the three hundred and fifty-fifth year after the founding of the city, the Fidenates rebelled against the Romans. The Veiens and King Tolumnius supported them.

(2) Both these cities are so close to Rome that Fidenae is six miles away, and Veii is eighteen miles away. They joined forces with the Volsci. However, under the dictatorship of Mam. Aemilius and the leadership of L. Quintius Cincinnatus, the Romans defeated them and even captured the king.

### Chapter 20: War with Veii, 396 BCE 

(1) After twenty years, the Veientani rebelled once again. Dictator Furius Camillus was sent against them. He first defeated them in battle and then, after a long siege, captured their city, the most ancient and wealthiest in Italy.

(2) Afterward, he also captured the city of the Falisci, which was no less renowned. However, he incurred envy due to the perception that he had unfairly divided the spoils. As a result, he was condemned and exiled from the city.

Rome Captured by the Gauls, 390 BCE 

(3) Immediately, the Senonian Gauls came to the city and, after defeating the Romans at the eleventh milestone from Rome near the river Allia, they occupied the city. Nothing could be defended except the Capitoline Hill. After a long siege and with the Romans suffering from hunger, Camillus arrived and decisively defeated the Gauls.

(4) Later, even after receiving gold to prevent the siege of the Capitoline Hill, the Gauls withdrew. Camillus pursued them and recovered both the gold given to them and all the military standards they had captured.

(5) Thus, triumphantly, he entered the city for the third time and was hailed as the second Romulus, as if he himself were the founder of the nation.

## Book 2: From the Capture of the City to the End of the First Punic War, 390 – 241 BCE 

### Chapter 1: Military Tribunes with Consular Power Elected, 444 BCE 

(1) In the three hundred and sixty-fifth year from the founding of the city, after it was first captured, the dignities were changed, and instead of two consuls, military tribunes with consular power were made. From here, the Roman state began to grow.

(2) For Camillus in that year conquered the city of the Volscians, which had waged war for seventy years, and occupied the city of the Aequi and the Sutrini [and] all, having destroyed their armies, and celebrated three triumphs at once.

### Chapter 2 

(1) T. Quintius Cincinnatus also pursued the Praenestines, who had come to the gates of the city of Rome with war, defeated them at the river Allia, added eight cities, which were under them, to the Romans, attacked Praeneste itself and accepted it in surrender.

(2) All these things were accomplished by him in twenty days and a triumph was decreed for him.

### Chapter 3 

But the dignity of the military tribunes did not last long. For after a while it pleased no one to be made and a four-year period flowed in the city, so that there were no greater powers there. However, the military tribunes with consular power again assumed dignity and persevered for three years. Again consuls were made.

### Chapter 4: Death of Camillus, 365 BCE 

L. Genucius and Q. Servilius were consuls, Camillus died. The second honor after Romulus was conferred on him.

### Chapter 5: Invasion of the Gauls; Torquatus, 361 BCE 

T. Quintius dictator was sent against the Gauls, who had come to Italy. They had settled from the city at the fourth mile across the Anio river. There the most noble of the senators, a young man L. Manlius, went forward against a Gaul who had challenged him to single combat, killed him and, having lifted the golden torque and placed it on his own neck, he took the nickname Torquatus for himself and his descendants forever. The Gauls were put to flight, soon even defeated by C. Suplicius dictator. Not long after, the Tuscans were defeated by C. Marcius and eight thousand prisoners from them were led in triumph.

### Chapter 6: First Samnite War, 343 – 341 BCE 

(1) The census was taken again. And when the Latins, who had been subdued by the Romans, did not want to provide soldiers, only recruits were chosen from the Romans, and ten legions were made, which mode produced sixty or more thousands of armed men. Although the Roman state was still small, yet such great courage was in military affairs.

(2) When they had set out against the Gauls under the leadership of L. Furius, a certain one of the Gauls challenged one of the Romans, who was the best.

(3) Then M. Valerius, a military tribune, offered himself, and when he had gone forward armed, a raven sat on his right arm.

(4) Soon, having begun the battle against the Gaul, the same raven beat the eyes of the Gaul with its wings and claws, so that he could not look straight. Thus he was killed by the tribune Valerius. He gave not only victory to him, but also a name: for afterwards he was called Corvinus. And because of this merit he was made consul at the age of twenty-three.

### Chapter 7: Latin War, 340 – 338 BCE 

(1) The Latins, who did not want to give soldiers, also began to demand this from the Romans, that one consul be created from their people, the other from the Roman people.

(2) When this was denied, war was undertaken against them and they were defeated in a huge battle; and triumph was celebrated over these thoroughly subdued ones. Statues were placed on the rostra for the consuls because of the merit of the victory.

(3) In that year also Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great.

### Chapter 8: Second Samnite War, 36 – 304 BCE 

(1) Now the Romans began to be powerful. For war was being waged in the hundred and thirtieth mile from the city with the Samnites, who are in the middle between Picenum, Campania and Apulia.

(2) L. Papirius Cursor with the honor of dictator set out for that war. When he returned to Rome, he ordered Q. Fabius Maximus, the master of the horse, whom he had left with the army, not to fight while he was absent.

(3) He, having found an opportunity, fought most successfully and destroyed the Samnites. For this reason, having been condemned to death by the dictator, because he had fought while he forbade it, he was freed by the great favor of the soldiers and the people, with such a sedition stirred up by Papirius, that he himself was almost killed.

### Chapter 9: Romans Defeated at Caudine Forks, 321 BCE 

 (1) Afterwards the Samnites defeated the Romans with great disgrace under the consuls T. Veturius and Sp. Postumius and sent them under the yoke. However, the peace was dissolved by the senate and the people, which had been made with them out of necessity. Afterwards the Samnites were defeated by L. Papirius the consul, seven thousand of them were sent under the yoke. Papirius was the first to triumph over the Samnites.

(2) At that time Ap. Claudius the censor brought in the Claudia water and paved the Appian way. The Samnites, having renewed the war, defeated Q. Fabius Maximus with three thousand men killed. Afterwards, when his father Fabius Maximus had been his legate, he both defeated the Samnites and captured many of their towns.

(3) Then P. Cornelius Rufinus M. Curius Dentatus, both consuls, having been sent against the Samnites, defeated them in huge battles.

(4) Then they ended the war with the Samnites, which had been waged for forty-nine years: nor was there any enemy within Italy, who had more fatigued Roman courage.

### Chapter 10: War with the Gauls and Etruscans, 283 BCE 

After a few years had passed, again the forces of the Gauls joined themselves against the Romans with the Tuscans and Samnites, but when they were heading for Rome, they were destroyed by Cn. Cornelius Dolabella the consul.

### Chapter 11: War with Tarentum and Pyrrhus, 281 – 272 BCE. Battle of Heraclea, 280 BCE 

(1) At the same time war was declared on the Tarentines, who are now in the farthest part of Italy, because they had done an injury to the ambassadors of the Romans. They asked Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, for help against the Romans, who traced his origin from the race of Achilles. He soon came to Italy; then for the first time the Romans fought with a foreign enemy.

(2) A consul, P. Valerius Laevinus, was sent against him. When he had captured the scouts of Pyrrhus, he ordered them to be led through the camp, to show all the army and then to be dismissed, so that they might report to Pyrrhus whatever the Romans were doing. Soon, having begun the battle, when Pyrrhus was already fleeing, he won with the help of the elephants, which the Romans, not knowing them, had feared.

(3) But night put an end to the battle; however, Laevinus fled during the night, Pyrrhus captured eighteen hundred Romans and treated them with the highest honor, buried the dead. When he had seen them lying dead with a wound in front and a fierce expression, even though they were dead, he is said to have raised his hands to heaven with this voice: that he could have been the master of the whole world, if such soldiers had fallen to him.

### Chapter 12: Embassy of Cineas 

(1) Afterwards Pyrrhus, having joined the Samnites, Lucanians, Bruttians to himself, went to Rome, devastated everything with sword and fire, ravaged Campania and came to Praeneste, the eighteenth mile from the city.

(2) Soon, from the fear of the army, which was following him with the consul, he retreated into Campania. Ambassadors were sent to Pyrrhus about ransoming the captives, they were received honorably by him, he sent the captives to Rome without a price.

(3) He admired one of the ambassadors of the Romans, Fabricius, so much, when he had learned that he was poor, that he wished to tempt him with a quarter of the kingdom promised, so that he would cross over to him; he was despised by Fabricius.

(4) Therefore, since Pyrrhus was held in great admiration by the Romans, he sent an ambassador, who would seek peace on equal terms, a very important man, Cineas by name, so that Pyrrhus would retain part of Italy, which he had already occupied by arms.

### Chapter 13 

(1) Peace was not pleasing: Pyrrhus was ordered by the Senate that he could not have peace with the Romans unless he had left Italy.

(2) Then the Romans ordered all the captives, whom Pyrrhus had returned, to be infamous, because they could have been captured armed, and not before they returned to their old state, unless they had brought back the spoils of two slain enemies. Thus the legate of Pyrrhus returned.

(3) From whom when Pyrrhus asked what kind of Rome he had found, Cineas said he had seen the homeland of kings; evidently almost all there are such as Pyrrhus alone was thought to be in Epirus and the rest of Greece.

(4) Leaders P. Sulpicius and Decius Mus were sent against Pyrrhus. When the battle was joined, Pyrrhus was wounded, elephants were killed, twenty thousand of the enemy were killed and only five thousand of the Romans; Pyrrhus was driven to Tarentum.

### Chapter 14: Fabricius; Battle of Beneventum, 275 BCE 

(1) After a year had passed, Fabricius was sent against Pyrrhus, who had previously been unable to be solicited among the ambassadors with a quarter of the kingdom promised.

(2) Then, when he and the king had neighboring camps, Pyrrhus' doctor came to him at night, promising that he would kill Pyrrhus with poison if he promised him something. Whom Fabricius ordered to be led back bound to his master and to tell Pyrrhus what the doctor had pledged against his head. Then the king is said to have admired him:

(3) “That is Fabricius, who can be turned from honesty more difficultly than the sun from its course.” Then the king went to Sicily. Fabricius triumphed over the defeated Lucanians and Samnites.

(4) Then consuls M. Curius Dentatus and Cornelius Lentulus were sent against Pyrrhus. Curius fought against him, defeated his army, drove him to Tarentum, captured the camp.

(5) On that day twenty-three thousand of the enemy were killed. Curius triumphed in his consulship. He first led four elephants to Rome. Pyrrhus also soon left Tarentum and was killed at Argos, a city of Greece.

### Chapter 15 

In the consulship of C. Fabius Licinius and C. Claudius Canina, in the four hundred and sixty-first year from the founding of the city, Alexandrian ambassadors sent by Ptolemy came to Rome and obtained the friendship they had sought from the Romans.

### Chapter 16 

In the consulship of Q. Ogulnius and C. Fabius Pictor, the Picentes started a war and were defeated by the following consuls P. Sempronius and Ap. Claudius and a triumph was held over them. The cities of Ariminus in Gaul and Beneventum in Samnium were founded by the Romans.

### Chapter 17 

In the consulship of M. Atilius Regulus and L. Julius Libo, war was declared on the Salentines in Apulia and they were captured along with the city of Brundisium and a triumph was held over them.

### Chapter 18: First Punic War, 264 BCE – 241 BCE; Romans Victorious in Sicily, 264 BCE 

(1) In the four hundred and seventy-seventh year, when the name of the city of Rome was already famous, however, arms had not been moved outside Italy.

(2) Therefore, in order to find out what the forces of the Romans were, a census was held. Two hundred and ninety-two thousand three hundred and thirty-four citizens were found, although since the city was founded, wars had never ceased. And the first war was undertaken against the Africans in the consulship of Ap. Claudius and Q. Fulvius. They fought against them in Sicily and Ap. Claudius triumphed over the Africans and King Hiero of Sicily.

### Chapter 19 

(1) In the following year, in the consulship of Valerius Marcus and Otacilius [Crassus], great things were done by the Romans in Sicily. The Tauromenitans, the Catinaeans and moreover fifty cities were accepted in good faith.

(2) In the third year, war was prepared in Sicily against Hiero, king of the Sicilians. With all the nobility of the Syracusans, he obtained peace from the Romans and gave two hundred talents of silver.

(3) The Africans in Sicily were defeated and a second triumph was held in Rome over them.

### Chapter 20: Battle of Mylae, 260 BCE 

(1) In the fifth year of the Punic war, which was being waged against the Africans, the Romans first fought at sea in the consulship of C. Duilius and C. Cornelius Asina with prepared beaked ships, which they call Liburnians.

(2) Consul Cornelius was deceived by a trick. Duilius, having joined battle, defeated the Carthaginian leader, captured thirty-one ships, sank fourteen, captured seven thousand of the enemy, killed three thousand. No victory was more pleasing to the Romans, because, undefeated on land, now they also had the most power at sea.

(3) In the consulship of C. Aquilius Florus and L. Scipio, Scipio devastated Corsica and Sardinia, brought back many thousands of captives from there, held a triumph.

### Chapter 21: Invasion of Africa by the Romans, 256 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus, the war was transferred to Africa. He fought against Hamilcar, the Carthaginian leader, at sea and was defeated. For having lost sixty-four ships, he retreated. The Romans lost twenty-two.

(2) But when they had crossed into Africa, they first accepted the city of Clypea in Africa into surrender. The consuls proceeded as far as Carthage, and having devastated many places, Manlius returned victorious to Rome and brought back twenty-seven thousand captives, Atilius Regulus remained in Africa. He drew up a line of battle against the Africans.

(3) Having fought against three Carthaginian leaders, he was victorious, eighteen thousand of the enemy fell, five thousand with eighteen elephants were captured, seventy-four cities were accepted into good faith.

(4) Then the defeated Carthaginians sought peace from the Romans. When Regulus was unwilling to give peace except on the harshest conditions, the Africans sought help from the Lacedaemonians. And under the leadership of Xanthippus, who had been sent by the Lacedaemonians, the Roman leader Regulus was defeated with the utmost destruction.

(5) For only two thousand men from the entire Roman army escaped, five hundred with the commander Regulus were captured, thirty thousand were killed, Regulus himself was thrown into chains.

### Chapter 22: Romans Shipwrecked Near Sicily 

(1) In the consulship of M. Aemilius Paulus and Ser. Fulvius Nobilior, both Roman consuls set out for Africa with a fleet of three hundred ships. First they overcame the Africans in a naval battle.

(2) Aemilius the consul sank one hundred and four enemy ships, captured thirty with the fighters, either killed or captured fifteen thousand of the enemy, enriched his soldier with a huge booty. And Africa would have been subdued then, unless there was such a great famine that the army could not wait any longer.

(3) The consuls, returning with the victorious fleet, suffered shipwreck around Sicily and there was such a storm that out of four hundred and sixty-four ships, eighty could be saved; and at no time was such a maritime storm heard of. However, the Romans immediately repaired two hundred ships and their spirit was not broken in any way.

### Chapter 23 

(1) In the consulship of Cn. Servilius Caepio and C. Sempronius Blaesus, they set out for Africa with two hundred and sixty ships. They captured several cities.

(2) Bringing back a huge booty, they suffered shipwreck. Therefore, since continuous disasters were displeasing to the Romans, the Senate decreed that they should withdraw from naval battles and only sixty ships should be safe for the protection of Italy.

### Chapter 24: Battle of Panormus, 250 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of L. Caecilius Metellus and C. Furius Placidus, Metellus in Sicily overcame the African leader coming with 130 elephants and large forces, twenty thousand of the enemy were killed, twenty-six elephants were captured, the rest wandering through the Numidians, whom he had for help, he collected and led to Rome with a huge procession, when the number of 130 elephants filled all the roads.

Regulus Sent to Rome to Solicit Peace, 250 BCE 

(2) After these disasters, the Carthaginians asked for the leader Regulus, whom they had captured, to go to Rome and obtain peace from the Romans and make an exchange of captives.

### Chapter 25 

(1) When he had come to Rome, he was led into the Senate and did nothing as if he were a Roman and said that he had ceased to be a Roman from that day, when he had come into the power of the Africans.

(2) Therefore, he also removed his wife from his embrace and advised the Senate not to make peace with the Carthaginians. For they, broken by so many disasters, have no hope; it is not worth it, that so many thousands of captives should be returned for one old man and a few who had been captured from the Romans. And so he prevailed. For no one admitted the Africans seeking peace.

(3) He himself returned to Carthage, and when the Romans offered to keep him in Rome, he denied that he would stay in that city, in which, after he had served the Africans, he could not have the dignity of an honest citizen. Therefore, having returned to Africa, he was killed with all tortures.

### Chapter 26: Publius Claudius Defeated Near Drepana, 249 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of P. Claudius Pulcher and L. Junius, Claudius fought against the auspices and was defeated by the Carthaginians. For out of two hundred and twenty ships, he fled with thirty, ninety were captured with the fighters, the rest were sunk.

(2) Another consul also lost his fleet by shipwreck, however, he kept his army safe, because the shores were nearby.

### Chapter 27: Battle of Lilybaeum, 242 BCE. Battle of the Aegates Islands and End of the War, 241 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of C. Lutatius Catulus and A. Postumius Albinus, in the twenty-third year of the Punic war, Catulus waged war against the Africans. He set out with three hundred ships to Sicily; the Africans prepared four hundred against him.

(2) Never was a battle fought at sea with such large forces. Lutatius Catulus, sick, boarded the ship; for he had been wounded in the previous battle. A battle was fought against the city of Lilybaeum in Sicily with the great courage of the Romans.

(3) For sixty-three Carthaginian ships were captured, one hundred and twenty-five were sunk, thirty-two thousand of the enemy were captured, thirteen thousand were killed, an infinite amount of gold, silver, booty was brought under the power of the Romans. From the Roman fleet, twelve ships were sunk. The battle was fought on the sixth day before the Ides of March.

(4) Immediately the Carthaginians sought peace and peace was granted to them. The Roman captives, who were being held by the Carthaginians, were returned. The Carthaginians also asked that they be allowed to ransom those captives, whom the Romans were holding from the Africans. The Senate ordered that they be given without price, who were in public custody; but those who were held by private individuals, that they should return to Carthage with the price returned to the masters and that this price should be paid from the treasury rather than by the Carthaginians.

### Chapter 28 

Q. Lutatius and A. Manlius were created consuls. They waged war on the Faliscans, which was once a wealthy city of Italy. Both consuls, within six days from when they had come, carried it out with fifteen thousand of the enemy killed, the rest having been granted peace, however, the land was taken away from half of them.

## Book 3: From the End of the First to the End of the Second Punic War, 241 – 201 BCE 

### Chapter 1 

(1) Therefore, with the Punic war finished, which was drawn out over 23 years, the Romans, now known for their most illustrious glory, sent ambassadors to Ptolemy, the king of Egypt, promising aid, because the king of Syria, Antiochus, had waged war against him. He thanked the Romans, but did not accept aid from the Romans. For the battle had already been fought.

(2) At the same time, Hiero, the most powerful king of Sicily, came to Rome to watch the games and presented the people with a gift of two hundred thousand pecks of wheat.

### Chapter 2: Sardinia Taken by the Romans, 237 BCE 

In the consulship of L. Cornelius Lentulus and Fulvius Flaccus, to whom Hiero had come to Rome, war was also waged against the Ligures within Italy and triumphed over them. However, the Carthaginians were attempting to repair the war, inciting the Sardinians, who ought to have obeyed the Romans according to the terms of the peace, to rebel. However, a delegation of Carthaginians came to Rome and obtained peace.

### Chapter 3 

In the consulship of T. Manlius Torquatus and C. Atilius Bulbus, triumph was had over the Sardi and with peace made in all places, the Romans had no war, which had happened to them only once after Rome was founded, during the reign of Numa Pompilius.

### Chapter 4: War with the Illyrians, 229 BCE 

The consuls L. Postumius Albinus and Cn. Fulvius Centumalus waged war against the Illyrians and having captured many cities, they also accepted kings into surrender. And then for the first time, triumph was had over the Illyrians.

### Chapter 5: Invasion of the Gauls, 225 BCE 

In the consulship of L. Aemilius, huge forces of Gauls crossed the Alps. But all of Italy agreed for the Romans and it was handed down by Fabius the historian, who was present at that war, that eight hundred thousand men were prepared for that war. But the matter was carried out prosperously only by the consul. Forty thousand of the enemy were killed and a triumph was decreed for Aemilius.

### Chapter 6 

(1) Then, after several years, war was waged against the Gauls within Italy and the war was ended in the consulship of M. Claudius Marcellus and Cn. Cornelius Scipio. Then Marcellus fought with a small band of horsemen and killed the king of the Gauls, named Viridomarus, with his own hand.

(2) Afterwards, with his colleague, he killed huge forces of Gauls, stormed Mediolanum, brought great booty to Rome. And triumphing, Marcellus carried the spoils of the Gaul, placed on a pole, on his shoulders.

### Chapter 7: Second Punic War Begun, 218 BCE 

(1) In the consulship of M. Minucius Rufus and P. Cornelius, war was brought upon the Histri, because they had been robbing the ships of the Romans, which were bringing grain; and all were thoroughly subdued.

(2) In the same year, the second Punic war was brought upon the Romans by Hannibal, the leader of the Carthaginians: who, being twenty years old, having gathered forces of one hundred and fifty thousand, began to besiege Saguntum, a city of Spain, friendly to the Romans.

(3) To him, the Romans sent legates to denounce him, that he should abstain from war. He did not want to admit the legates. The Romans also sent [legates] to Carthage, that it should be ordered to Hannibal, not to wage war against the allies of the Roman people. Harsh responses were given by the Carthaginians. Meanwhile, the Saguntines were conquered by famine and those captured by Hannibal were afflicted with the worst punishments.

### Chapter 8: Hannibal Crosses the Alps  

(1) Then P. Cornelius Scipio set out with an army to Spain, Ti. Sempronius [set out] to Sicily. War was declared on the Carthaginians.

(2) Hannibal, having left his brother Hasdrubal in Spain, crossed the Pyrenees. He opened up the Alps, which were still impassable on that side. It is handed down that he brought eighty thousand foot soldiers, ten thousand horsemen, and thirty-seven elephants to Italy. Meanwhile, many Ligures and Gauls joined Hannibal. Sempronius Gracchus, having learned of Hannibal's arrival to Italy, transferred his army from Sicily to Ariminum.

### Chapter 9: Battle of Trebia, 218 BCE; Battle of Lake Trasumenus, 217 BCE 

(1) P. Cornelius Scipio was the first to meet Hannibal. Having engaged in battle, he was put to flight by his own [men] and he himself, having been wounded, returned to the camp. Sempronius Gracchus also engaged [in battle] at the river Trebia; he too was defeated. Many in Italy surrendered to Hannibal.

(2) Then, coming to Tuscany, Hannibal met the consul Flaminius. He killed Flaminius himself; twenty-five thousand Romans were killed, the rest fled. Q. Fabius Maximus was sent against Hannibal afterwards by the Romans. He broke him by delaying the battle, soon, having found an opportunity, he conquered.

### Chapter 10: Battle of Cannae, 216 BCE 

(1) In the five hundred and fortieth year from the founding of the city, L. Aemilius Paulus and P. Terentius Varro were sent against Hannibal and they succeeded Fabius, who, departing, warned both consuls, that they would defeat Hannibal, a cunning and impatient leader, in no other way than by delaying the battle.

(2) But with the impatience of the consul Varro, the other consul [that is Aemilius Paulus] disagreeing, when a battle had been fought at a village, which is called Cannae, in Apulia, both consuls were defeated by Hannibal.

(3) In that battle, three thousand Africans perished; a great part of Hannibal's army was wounded. However, in no Punic war were the Romans more heavily defeated; for in it the consul Aemilius Paulus perished, twenty consulars or praetorians [perished], thirty senators were captured or killed, three hundred noble men, forty thousand soldiers, three thousand and five hundred horsemen. In these evils, however, no one of the Romans deigned to mention peace. Slaves, which never before, were manumitted and made soldiers.

### Chapter 11: War in Spain, 218 BCE 

(1) After that battle, many cities of Italy, which had obeyed the Romans, transferred themselves to Hannibal. Hannibal offered to the Romans, that they ransom the captives, and a response was given by the Senate that those citizens were not necessary, who, although they were armed, could have been captured. He afterwards killed all with various punishments and sent three pecks of gold rings to Carthage, which he had taken off the hands of the Roman horsemen, senators and soldiers.

(2) Meanwhile, in Spain, where the brother of Hannibal, Hasdrubal, had remained with a large army, in order to subdue all of it to the Africans, he is defeated by two Scipios, Roman leaders. He loses in the battle thirty-five thousand men; of these, ten thousand are captured, twenty-five thousand are killed. Twelve thousand foot soldiers, four thousand horsemen, twenty elephants are sent to him by the Carthaginians to repair his forces.

### Chapter 12: Battle Near Nola, 215 BCE 

(1) In the fourth year, after Hannibal had come to Italy, M. Claudius Marcellus, the consul, fought well against Hannibal near the city of Nola in Campania. Hannibal occupied many cities of the Romans throughout Apulia, Calabria, and the Bruttii.

(2) At which time also the king of Macedonia, Philip, sent legates to him promising aid against the Romans under this condition, that, with the Romans destroyed, he himself also would receive aid against the Greeks from Hannibal.

(3) Therefore, with the legates of Philip captured and the matter known, the Romans ordered M. Valerius Laevinus to go to Macedonia, T. Manlius Torquatus the proconsul to Sardinia. For even that [place], having been incited by Hannibal, had deserted the Romans.

### Chapter 13

(1) Thus, at one time, battles were being fought in four places: in Italy against Hannibal, in Spain against his brother Hasdrubal, in Macedonia against Philip, and in Sardinia against the Sardinians and another Hasdrubal of Carthage.

(2) He was captured alive by T. Manlius, the proconsul, who had been sent to Sardinia, twelve thousand were killed with him, fifteen hundred were captured, and Sardinia was subdued by the Romans. Manlius, the victor, brought the captives and Hasdrubal back to Rome.

(3) Meanwhile, Philip is also defeated by Laevinus in Macedonia and in Spain by the Scipios, Hasdrubal and Mago, the third brother of Hannibal.

### Chapter 14: Campaign in Sicily, 214 – 210 BCE

(1) In the tenth year, after Hannibal had come to Italy, P. Sulpicius and Cn. Fulvius being consuls, Hannibal came as far as four miles from the city, his cavalry even up to the gate. Soon, fearing the arrival of the consuls with their army, Hannibal retreated to Campania.

(2) In Spain, both Scipios, who had been victorious for many years, were killed by Hasdrubal's brother, but the army remained intact; for they were deceived more by chance than by virtue.

(3) At this time also, a large part of Sicily was captured by the consul Marcellus, which the Africans had begun to hold, and the most noble city of Syracuse; a huge booty was brought to Rome.

(4) Laevinus in Macedonia made friendship with Philip and many peoples of Greece and Attalus, the king of Asia, and having gone to Sicily, he captured a certain Hanno, a leader of the Africans, at the city of Agrigentum along with the town itself; and he sent him to Rome with noble captives. He received forty cities into surrender, he stormed twenty-six. Thus, with all of Sicily recovered and Macedonia broken, he returned to Rome with great glory. Hannibal in Italy suddenly attacked Cn. Fulvius the consul and killed eight thousand men.

### Chapter 15: War in Spain, 210 – 206 CBE

(1) Meanwhile, to Spain, where two Scipios had been killed and there was no Roman leader, P. Cornelius Scipio is sent, the son of P. Scipio, who had waged war there, a man almost the first of all Romans both in his own age and in later time, aged twenty-four.

(2) He captures Carthage in Spain, in which the Africans had all their gold, silver and war equipment, also the most noble hostages, which they had received from the Spaniards.

(3) He also captures Mago, the brother of Hannibal, there, whom he sends to Rome with others. In Rome, there was great joy after this news. Scipio returned the Spanish hostages to their parents; wherefore almost all of Spain with one mind went over to him. After which he defeats Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, put to flight and captures a very large booty.

### Chapter 16: Recapture of Tarentum, 209 BCE

(1) Meanwhile in Italy, the consul Q. Fabius Maximus recaptured Tarentum, in which there were huge forces of Hannibal. There he also killed Carthalo, a leader of Hannibal, he sold twenty-five thousand men as captives, he distributed the booty among the soldiers, he brought the money of the men sold to the treasury. Then many cities of the Romans, which had previously gone over to Hannibal, again surrendered themselves to Fabius Maximus.

(2) In the following year, Scipio did great things in Spain both by himself and through his brother L. Scipio; they recovered seventy cities. However, in Italy the battle went badly. For the consul Claudius Marcellus was killed by Hannibal.

### Chapter 17

In the third year, after Scipio had set out for Spain, he again performs famous deeds. He received the king of Spain, defeated in a great battle, into friendship and was the first of all to not demand hostages from the defeated.

### Chapter 18: Battle of Metaurus, 207 BCE

(1) Despairing that Spain could be held against Scipio for any longer, Hannibal called his brother Hasdrubal to Italy with all his forces.

(2) Coming by the same route that Hannibal had also come, he fell into an ambush composed by the consuls AP. Claudius Nero and M. Livius Salinator at the city of Sena in Picenum. However, fighting strenuously, he was killed, his huge forces were captured or killed, a large weight of gold and silver was brought to Rome.

(3) After these things, Hannibal now began to distrust the outcome of the war. The Romans gained great courage; and so they themselves also called P. Cornelius Scipio from Spain. He came to Rome with great glory.

### Chapter 19

Q. Caecilius L. Valerius being consuls, all cities, which were held in Bruttium by Hannibal, surrendered themselves to the Romans.

### Chapter 20: Scipio Crosses into Africa, 204 BCE

(1) In the fourteenth year, after Hannibal had come to Italy, Scipio, who had done many good things in Spain, was made consul and sent to Africa. Something divine was thought to be in this man, so much so that it was thought that he even had conversation with the gods.

(2) He fights in Africa against Hanno, the leader of the Africans; he kills his army. In a second battle, he captures the camp with four thousand five hundred soldiers, eleven thousand killed. He captures Syphax, the king of Numidia, who had joined the Africans, and invades his camp. Syphax with the most noble Numidians and infinite spoils is sent to Rome by Scipio.

(3) When this thing was heard, almost all of Italy deserted Hannibal. He himself is ordered by the Carthaginians to return to Africa, which Scipio was devastating.

### Chapter 21: Efforts for Peace

(1) Thus, in the seventeenth year, Italy was freed from Hannibal. The Carthaginian envoys sought peace from Scipio.

(2) They were sent by him to the senate at Rome. Forty-five days of truce were given to them, so that they could go to Rome and return, and thirty thousand pounds of silver were received from them. The senate ordered peace to be made with the Carthaginians at the discretion of Scipio.

(3) Scipio gave them these conditions: that they should not have more than thirty ships, that they should give five hundred thousand pounds of silver, that they should return captives and deserters.

### Chapter 22

(1) Meanwhile, with Hannibal coming to Africa, peace was disturbed, many hostile things were done by the Africans.

(2) However, their envoys coming from the city were captured by the Romans, but were dismissed by the order of Scipio. Hannibal also, defeated by Scipio in frequent battles, himself also seeks peace. When it had come to a conference, it was given on the same conditions as before, with five hundred thousand pounds of silver added to a hundred thousand pounds because of the new treachery. The Carthaginians disliked the conditions and ordered Hannibal to fight. War is waged on Carthage by Scipio and Masinissa, another king of the Numidians, who had made friendship with Scipio.

(3) Hannibal sent three scouts to Scipio's camp, who, when captured, Scipio ordered to be led around through the camp and to show them the whole army, soon also to give them lunch and to dismiss them, so that they might report to Hannibal what they had seen among the Romans.

### Chapter 23: Battle of Zama, 202 BCE. End of the Second Punic War, 201 BCE

(1) Meanwhile, a battle was arranged by each leader, such as was hardly in any memory, when the most experienced men led their forces to war. Scipio, the victor, withdrew, almost capturing Hannibal himself, who first escaped with many cavalry, then with twenty, finally with four.

(2) Found in the camp of Hannibal were two hundred thousand pounds of silver, eighty of gold, the rest of the equipment was plentiful. After this contest, peace was made with the Carthaginians. Scipio returned to Rome, triumphed with great glory and began to be called Africanus from this.

(3) The second Punic war came to an end after the nineteenth year, when it had begun.

## Book 4: From the End of the Second Punic War to the End of the War with Jugurtha, 201 – 106 BCE 

### Chapter 1: Second Macedonian War, 200 – 106 BCE 

After the Punic War, the Macedonian War followed against King Philip in the five hundred and fifty-first year from the founding of the city.

### Chapter 2 

(1) T. Quintius Flamininus successfully waged war against Philip. Peace was given to him on these terms: that he would not wage war on the Greek states, which the Romans had defended against him, that he would return captives and deserters, that he would have only fifty ships, that he would give the rest to the Romans, that he would pay four thousand pounds of silver per year for ten years, and that he would give his son Demetrius as a hostage.

(2) T. Quintius also waged war against the Lacedaemonians, defeated their leader Nabis, and accepted them into his protection on whatever terms he wished. He led the most noble hostages before his chariot in great glory, Demetrius the son of Philip and Armenes of Nabis.

### Chapter 3: Syro-Aetolian War, 192 – 189 BCE 

(1) After the Macedonian War, the Syrian War followed against King Antiochus under the consulship of P. Cornelius Scipio and M. Acilius Glabrio.

(2) Hannibal had joined this Antiochus, leaving his homeland Carthage for fear that it would be handed over to the Romans. M. Acilius Glabrio fought well in Achaea. The king Antiochus' camp was captured in a night battle, he himself was put to flight. Because Philip had been an aid to the Romans against Antiochus, his son Demetrius was returned.

### Chapter 4 

(1) Under the consulship of L. Cornelius Scipio and C. Laelius, Scipio Africanus, as a legate to his brother L. Cornelius Scipio the consul, set out against Antiochus. Hannibal, who was with Antiochus, was defeated in a naval battle.

(2) Afterwards, Antiochus himself was routed in a great battle by the consul Cornelius Scipio around Sipylus, near the city of Magnesia in Asia. Eumenes, the brother of King Attalus, who founded Eumeneia in Phrygia, was an aid to the Romans in that battle. Fifty thousand infantry, three cavalry were killed in that contest on the part of the king.

(3) Then the king sought peace. It was given by the senate on the same terms, although he was defeated, as it had been offered before: that he would withdraw from Europe and Asia and keep himself within the Taurus, that he would provide ten thousand talents and twenty hostages, that he would hand over Hannibal, the instigator of the war. All the cities of Asia, which Antiochus had lost in the war, were given by the senate to King Eumenes, and many cities were granted to the Rhodians, who had brought aid to the Romans against King Antiochus. Scipio returned to Rome, triumphed in great glory. He himself also took the name Asiagenes in imitation of his brother, because he had conquered Asia, just as his brother was called Africanus because he had subdued Africa.

### Chapter 5 

(1) In the consulship of Sp. Postumius Albinus and Q. Marcius Philippus, M. Fulvius triumphed over the Aetolians.

(2) Hannibal, who, after Antiochus was defeated, had fled to Prusias, king of Bithynia, for fear of being handed over to the Romans, was also sought by him through T. Quintius Flamininus. And when he was to be handed over to the Romans, he drank poison and was buried at Libyssa in the territory of the Nicomedians.

### Chapter 6: Third Macedonian War, 176 – 168 BCE 

(1) After the death of Philip, king of Macedonia, who had both waged war against the Romans and later brought aid to the Romans against Antiochus, his son Perseus rebelled in Macedonia with large forces prepared for war.

(2) For he had as allies Cotys, king of Thrace, and Gentius by name, king of Illyricum. But the Romans had as allies Eumenes, king of Asia, Ariarathes of Cappadocia, Antiochus of Syria, Ptolemy of Egypt, Masinissa of Numidia. But Prusias of Bithynia, although he had the sister of Perseus as his wife, showed himself fair to both sides.

(3) The Roman leader P. Licinius the consul was sent against him and was defeated by the king in a serious battle. Nevertheless, the Romans, although they were defeated, did not want to grant peace to the king asking for it except on these conditions, that he and his men would surrender to the Roman senate and people.

(4) Soon L. Aemilius Paulus the consul was sent against him and in Illyricum C. Anicius the praetor against Gentius, but Gentius was easily defeated in one battle and soon surrendered himself. His mother and wife and two sons, also his brother, came into the power of the Romans at the same time. Thus the war was finished within thirty days, and it was announced that Gentius was defeated before it was announced that the war had begun.

### Chapter 7: The Battle of Pydna, 168 BCE 

(1) With Perseus, however, Aemilius Paulus the consul fought on the third day before the Nones of September and defeated him with twenty thousand of his infantry killed. The cavalry fled intact with the king. One hundred Roman soldiers were lost. All the cities of Macedonia, which the king had held, surrendered to the Romans; the king himself, when he was deserted by his friends, came into the power of Paulus.

(2) But the consul Aemilius Paulus did not treat him with the honor of a defeated man. For he did not allow him to fall at his feet when he was willing, and he placed him next to himself in the seat. These laws were given by the Romans to the Macedonians and Illyrians:

(3) that they would be free and would pay half of those tributes, which they had paid to the kings, so that it would appear that the Roman people fought more for equity than for greed. Therefore, in a meeting of countless peoples, Paulus announced this and fed the delegations of many nations, which had come to him, in a most magnificent banquet, saying that the same man ought to be able to win in war and to be elegant in the arrangement of a banquet.

### Chapter 8: Revolt in Epirus 

(1) Soon he captured seventy cities of Epirus, which were rebelling, and distributed the booty to the soldiers. He returned to Rome in great pomp in the ship of Perseus, which is said to have been of unusual size, so much so that it is said to have had sixteen rows of oars. He triumphed most magnificently in a golden chariot with his two sons standing on either side. Two sons of the king and Perseus himself, forty-five years old, were led before his chariot.

(2) After him also Anicius triumphed over the Illyrians. Gentius was led before his chariot with his brother and sons. For this spectacle, kings of many nations came to Rome, among others also Attalus and Eumenes, kings of Asia, and Prusias of Bithynia. They were received with great honor and, with the permission of the senate, they placed the gifts, which they had brought, in the Capitol. Prusias also commended his son Nicomedes to the senate.

### Chapter 9 

In the following year L. Memmius fought well in Lusitania. Marcellus afterwards the consul conducted prosperous affairs there.

### Chapter 10: Third Punic War, 149 – 146 BCE 

(1) Then the third war against Carthage is undertaken, in the six hundred and second year from the founding of the city, under the consulship of L. Manlius Censorinus and M. Manilius, in the fifty-first year after the second Punic War had been concluded.

(2) They set out and besieged Carthage. Against them Hasdrubal, the leader of the Carthaginians, was fighting. Famea, another leader, was in charge of the Carthaginian cavalry.

(3) Scipio then, the grandson of Scipio Africanus, was serving as a tribune there. There was a great fear and reverence for him among all. For he was considered both most prepared for fighting and most wise. Therefore, through him many things were successfully carried out by the consuls and nothing more did either Hasdrubal or Famea avoid than to commit against that part of the Romans where Scipio was fighting.

### Chapter 11 

Around the same time, Masinissa, king of the Numidians and a friend of the Roman people for nearly sixty years, died in the ninety-seventh year of his life, leaving forty-four sons. He ordered Scipio to divide his kingdom among his sons.

### Chapter 12 

(1) Therefore, when Scipio's name was famous, he was made consul while still young and sent against Carthage. He captured and destroyed it. He returned the spoils found there, which Carthage had collected from the destruction of various cities, and the ornaments of the cities to the cities of Sicily, Italy, and Africa, which recognized them as their own. Thus, Carthage was destroyed in the seven hundredth year after it was founded.

(2) Scipio earned the name that his grandfather had received, namely, because of his virtue, he too was called Africanus, the younger.

### Chapter 13 

Meanwhile, in Macedonia, a certain Pseudophilippus took up arms and defeated the Roman praetor P. Juventius, who had been sent against him, to destruction. After him, Q. Caecilius Metellus, a leader sent by the Romans against Pseudophilippus, was sent and, having killed twenty-five thousand of his men, recovered Macedonia. He also brought Pseudophilippus himself into his power.

### Chapter 14: Destruction of Corinth, 146 BCE 

(1) The Corinthians were also declared war, the most noble city of Greece, because of the injury to the Roman legates. This Mummius, the consul, captured and destroyed.

(2) Therefore, three very famous triumphs were held at Rome at the same time: Africanus from Africa, before whose chariot Hasdrubal was led, Metellus from Macedonia, before whose chariot Andriscus, the same who was also Pseudophilippus, Mummius from Corinth, before whom bronze statues and painted tablets and other ornaments of the most famous city were carried.

### Chapter 15 

Again in Macedonia, Pseudoperseus, who claimed to be the son of Perseus, rebelled by gathering slaves and, having sixteen thousand armed men, was defeated by the quaestor Tremellius.

### Chapter 16: Celtiberian War, 154 BCE 

(1) At the same time, Metellus did great things in Celtiberia among the Spaniards. Q. Pompeius succeeded him.

(2) Not much later, Q. Caepio was also sent to the same war, which a certain Viriathus was waging against the Romans in Lusitania. Out of fear of him, Viriathus was killed by his own men, after he had moved the Spaniards against the Romans for fourteen years. He was first a shepherd, then a leader of robbers, finally he stirred up such large peoples to war, that he was thought to be a champion against the Romans of Spain.

(3) And when his killers sought a reward from the consul Caepio, it was answered that it had never pleased the Romans for commanders to be killed by their own soldiers.

### Chapter 17: Capture of Numantia, 133 BCE 

(1) Q. Pompeius, then consul, was defeated by the Numantines, who were the richest city of Spain, made an ignoble peace. After him, C. Hostilius Mancinus, consul again, made an infamous peace with the Numantines, which the people and the senate ordered to be broken and Mancinus himself to be handed over to the enemies, so that in him, whom they had as the author of the treaty, they might avenge the injury of the broken treaty.

(2) After such great disgrace, by which the Roman armies had been twice subjugated by the Numantines, P. Scipio Africanus was made consul for the second time and sent to Numantia. He first corrected the corrupt and cowardly soldier by training rather than punishing, without any harshness, he brought him back to Roman discipline. He defeated Jugurtha in various battles, killed or captured his elephants, captured many of his cities. And when he was now about to put an end to the war, he was succeeded by C. Marius.

### Chapter 18 

At the same time, Attalus, king of Asia, brother of Eumenes, died and left the Roman people as his heir. Thus, Asia came to the Roman empire by testament.

### Chapter 19 

Soon after, D. Junius Brutus celebrated a great triumph over the Callaeci and Lusitanians and P. Scipio Africanus celebrated a second triumph over the Numantines fourteen years after he had celebrated the first from Africa.

### Chapter 20: War with Aristonicus, 131 BCE 

(1) Meanwhile, a war was stirred up in Asia by Aristonicus, the son of Eumenes, who had been conceived by a concubine. This Eumenes had been the brother of Attalus. Sent against him was P. Licinius Crassus, who had the aid of countless kings. For both Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, helped the Romans and Mithradates Ponticus, with whom there was later a very serious war, and Ariaratus Cappadox and Pylaemenes Paphlagon. However, Crassus was defeated and killed in battle. His head was offered to Aristonicus, his body was buried in Smyrna.

(2) Afterwards, Perperna, a Roman consul, who was coming as successor to Crassus, having heard of the fortune of the war, hurried to Asia and, having defeated Aristonicus in battle, compelled him to surrender by famine at the city of Stratonice, to which he had fled. Aristonicus was strangled in prison by order of the senate at Rome. For he could not be triumphed over, because Perperna, returning from Pergamum to Rome, had died.

### Chapter 21 

L. Caecilius Metellus and T. Quintius Flamininus, consuls, Carthage in Africa was repaired by order of the senate, which now remains, twenty-two years after it had been overthrown by Scipio. Roman citizens were led there.

### Chapter 22: War with Transalpine Gauls, 125 – 121 BCE 

In the six hundred and twenty-seventh year from the founding of the city, C. Cassius Longinus and Sex. Domitius Calvinus, consuls, brought war to the Transalpine Gauls and killed an infinite multitude of the Arverni, then the most noble city, and their leader Bituitus, near the Rhone river. A huge booty from the torques of the Gauls was brought to Rome. Bituitus surrendered to Domitius and was led by him to Rome and both consuls celebrated a great triumph.

### Chapter 23 

M. Porcius Cato and Q. Marcius Rex, consuls, in the six hundred and thirty-third year from the founding of the city, a colony was led to Narbonne in Gaul and a year later, by L. Caecilius Metellus and Q. Mucius Scaevola, consuls, a triumph was celebrated over Dalmatia.

### Chapter 24 

From the founding of the city in the six hundred and thirty-fifth year, C. Cato, consul, waged war against the Scordisci and fought disgracefully.

### Chapter 25 

C. Caecilius Metellus and Cn. Carbo, consuls, two Metelli brothers on the same day, one from Sardinia, the other from Thrace, celebrated a triumph and it was announced at Rome that the Cimbri had crossed from Gaul into Italy.

### Chapter 26: War with Jugurtha, 111 – 104 BCE 

(1) P. Scipio Nasica and L. Calpurnius Bestia, consuls, war was brought against Jugurtha, king of the Numidians, because he had killed Adherbal and Hiempsal, the sons of Micipsa, his brothers, kings and friends of the Roman people. Sent against him was the consul Calpurnius Bestia, corrupted by the king's money, he made a most disgraceful peace with him, which was disapproved by the senate.

(2) Afterwards, against the same in the following year, Sp. Postumius Albinus set out. He also fought disgracefully against the Numidians through his brother.

### Chapter 27 

(1) Third, Q. Caecilius Metellus, consul, was sent. He corrected the corrupt and cowardly soldier with great severity and moderation, since he did nothing bloody against anyone, he brought him back to Roman discipline. He defeated Jugurtha in various battles, killed or captured his elephants, captured many of his cities. And when he was now about to put an end to the war, he was succeeded by C. Marius.

(2) He defeated both Jugurtha and Bocchus, king of Mauretania, who had begun to bring aid to Jugurtha. He himself also captured some towns of Numidia and put an end to the war by capturing Jugurtha through his quaestor Cornelius Sulla, a great man, Bocchus handing over Jugurtha, who had fought for him before.

(3) By M. Junius Silanus, colleague of Q. Metellus, the Cimbri were defeated in Gaul and by Minucius Rufus in Macedonia the Scordisci and Triballi and by Servilius Caepio in Spain the Lusitanians.

(4) Two triumphs were also celebrated over Jugurtha, the first by Metellus, the second by Marius. However, before Marius’ chariot, Jugurtha was led with his two sons in chains and soon strangled in prison by order of the consul.

## Book 5: From the End of the War with Jugurtha to the End of the First Civil War, 106 – 81 BCE 

### Chapter 1: War with the Cimbri and Teutones, 105 – 101 BCE. Battle of Aquae Sextiae, 102 BCE 

(1) While the war against Jugurtha was being waged in Numidia, the Roman consuls M. Manlius and Q. Caepio were defeated by the Cimbri, Teutones, Tugurini, and Ambrones, which were German and Gallic tribes, near the Rhone river with a huge slaughter and even lost their camp and a large part of their army.

(2) There was a great fear in Rome, as great as hardly in the time of Hannibal during the Punic war, lest the Gauls come to Rome again.

(3) Therefore, Marius, after the victory over Jugurtha, was made consul for the second time and the war against the Cimbri and Teutones was decreed to him. The consulship was also deferred to him for the third and fourth time, because the Cimbrian war was being prolonged.

(4) But in his fourth consulship he had Q. Lutatius Catulus as a colleague. Therefore, he clashed with the Cimbri and in two battles killed two hundred thousand of the enemy, captured eighty thousand and their leader Teutobod. Because of this merit, he was made consul for the fifth time while absent.

### Chapter 2: Battle of Vercellae, 101 BCE  

(1) Meanwhile, the Cimbri and Teutones, whose force was still infinite, crossed over to Italy. Again, C. Marius and Q. Catulus fought against them, but more successfully on the part of Catulus.

(2) For in the battle, which both fought together, one hundred and forty thousand were killed either in battle or in flight, sixty thousand were captured. Three hundred soldiers from both armies perished. Thirty-three standards were taken from the Cimbri; of these, the army of Marius brought back two, the army of Catulus thirty-one. This was the end of the war; a triumph was decreed to both.

### Chapter 3: Social War, 90 – 88 BCE 

(1) In the six hundred and fifty-ninth year from the founding of the city, when almost all other wars had ceased, in Italy a very serious war was started by the Picentes, Marsi, and Peligni. They, who for many years now had been obeying the Roman people, then began to assert equal freedom for themselves. This war was very destructive.

(2) P. Rutilius, consul, was killed in it, Caepio, a noble youth, Porcius Cato, another consul. The leaders against the Romans for the Picentes and Marsi were T. Vettius, Hierius Asinius, T. Herennius, A. Cluentius.

(3) The Romans fought well against them by C. Marius, who had been consul six times, and by Cn. Pompey, but especially by L. Cornelius Sulla, who among other excellent things so routed Cluentius, the enemy's leader, with great forces, that he lost only one of his own men.

(4) This war was drawn out for four years, however, with serious disaster. Finally, in the fifth year, it came to an end through L. Cornelius Sulla, consul, who had previously in the same war done many strenuous things, but as praetor.

### Chapter 4: First Mithridatic War, 88 – 84 BCE 

(1) In the six hundred and second year from the founding of the city, the first civil war was stirred up in Rome, in the same year also the Mithridatic. C. Marius, consul for the sixth time, gave cause for the civil war.

(2) For when Sulla, consul, about to wage war against Mithridates, who had occupied Asia and Achaia, was being sent, and he held his army in Campania for a short time, so that the remnants of the social war, about which we have spoken, which had been waged within Italy, might be removed, Marius aspired to be sent to the Mithridatic war. Because of this, Sulla, moved, came with his army to the city. There he fought against Marius and Sulpicius. He was the first to enter the city of Rome armed, killed Sulpicius, drove Marius into exile and so, having arranged for consuls for the future year Cn. Octavius and L. Cornelius Cinna, he set out for Asia.

### Chapter 5: Mithridates invades Asia 

(1) For Mithridates, who was king of Pontus and held Lesser Armenia and the whole Pontic sea in a circuit with the Bosporus, first wanted to expel Nicomedes, a friend of the Roman people, from Bithynia and commanded the senate that he would bring war against him because of the injuries which he had suffered. The senate responded to Mithridates, if he did that, that he himself would suffer war from the Romans.

(2) Therefore, angry, he immediately occupied Cappadocia and drove Ariobarzanes, king and friend of the Roman people, from it. Soon he also invaded Bithynia and Paphlagonia, having driven out the kings from it, friends of the Roman people Pylaemenes and Nicomedes. From there he hurried to Ephesus and sent letters throughout all Asia, that wherever Roman citizens were found, they should be killed in one day.

### Chapter 6: Sulla Takes Athens, 87 BCE. Battle of Chaeronea, 86 BCE 

(1) Meanwhile, even the city of Athens of Achaia, was handed over to Mithridates by Aristion the Athenian. For Mithridates had already sent to Achaia his leader Archelaus with one hundred and twenty thousand horsemen and footmen, through whom also the rest of Greece was occupied. Sulla besieged Archelaus near Piraeus not far from Athens, he captured Athens itself.

(2) Afterwards, having engaged in battle against Archelaus, he so defeated him, that out of one hundred and twenty thousand hardly ten were left to Archelaus, only thirteen men were killed from Sulla's army. Having learned of this battle, Mithridates sent seventy thousand select men from Asia to Archelaus, against whom Sulla again engaged. In the first battle fifteen thousand of the enemy were killed and Diogenes, the son of Archelaus; in the second all the forces of Mithridates were wiped out, Archelaus himself lay naked in the marshes for three days. Having heard of this, Mithridates ordered that peace be made with Sulla.

### Chapter 7: Terms of Peace, 84 BCE. Sulla’s Return to Italy, 83 BCE 

(1) Meanwhile, at that time, Sulla also conquered the Dardani, Scordisci, Dalmatians, and Maedi, he took others into his trust.

(2) But when the envoys from king Mithridates, who were seeking peace, had come, Sulla responded that he would not give it otherwise, unless the king, having left those things which he had occupied, returned to his kingdom. However, afterwards both came to a conference. Peace was arranged between them, so that Sulla, hurrying to the civil war, would not have danger from the rear.

(3) For while Sulla was defeating Mithridates in Achaia and Asia, Marius, who had been driven into exile, and Cornelius Cinna, one of the consuls, started a war in Italy and having entered the city of Rome killed the most noble men from the senate and consular men, proscribed many, having overthrown the house of Sulla, drove his sons and wife into exile.

(4) The entire remaining senate, having fled from the city, came to Sulla in Greece praying that he would come to the aid of the fatherland. He crossed over into Italy about to wage civil war against Norbanus and Scipio the consuls. And in the first battle he fought against Norbanus not far from Capua. Then he killed six thousand of his men, captured six, lost one hundred and twenty-four of his own. From there he also turned to Scipio and before the battle took his entire army into surrender without bloodshed.

### Chapter 8: Battle of Colline Gate, 82 BCE 

(1) But when the consuls had been changed at Rome, Marius, the son of Marius, and Papirius Carbo had received the consulship, Sulla fought against the younger Marius and having killed fifteen thousand of his men, lost four hundred of his own. Soon he also entered the city. He pursued Marius, the son of Marius, to Praeneste and besieged him and drove him to death. Again, he had a very serious battle against Lamponius and Carinatus, leaders of the Marian party, at the Colline gate. Seventy thousand of the enemy are said to have been in that battle against Sulla. Twelve thousand surrendered to Sulla, the rest were consumed in the line of battle, in the camps, in flight by the insatiable anger of the victors.

(2) Cn. also Carbo, the other consul, fled from Rimini to Sicily and there was killed by Cn. Pompey, whom Sulla, having known his industry, had put in charge of the armies when he was a young man and twenty-one years old, so that he would be considered second to Sulla.

### Chapter 9 

(1) Therefore, with Carbo having been killed, Pompey recovered Sicily. Having crossed over from there to Africa, he killed Domitius, the leader of the Marian party, and Hierdas, the king of Mauretania, who was bringing aid to Domitius. After these things, Sulla triumphed over Mithridates with great glory. Cn. also Pompey, because no tribute had been granted to the Romans, while he was in his twenty-fourth year, triumphed over Africa.

(2) These two most disastrous wars, the Italian, which is also called the social, and the civil, which both were drawn out over ten years, consumed more than one hundred and fifty thousand men, twenty-four consular men, seven praetorian men, sixty aedilician men, almost two hundred senators.

## Book 6: From the End of the First Civil War to the Assassination of Caesar, 81 – 44 BCE

### Chapter 1: War with Sertorius, 78 – 72 BCE

(1) During the consulship of M. Aemilius Lepidus and Q. Catulus, after Sulla had established the republic, new wars broke out: one in Spain, another in Pamphylia and Cilicia, a third in Macedonia, and a fourth in Dalmatia.

(2) For Sertorius, who had been part of the Marian party, fearing the fate of the others who had been killed, stirred up wars in Spain. Commanders were sent against him, Q. Caecilius Metellus, the son of the one who defeated King Jugurtha, and L. Domitius the praetor. Domitius was killed by Sertorius's commander Hirtuleius. Metellus fought against Sertorius with varying success. Later, when Metellus alone was thought to be unequal to the fight, Cn. Pompey was sent to Spain.

(3) Thus, with two opposing commanders, Sertorius often fought with varying fortune. Finally, in the eighth year, he was killed by his own men, and an end was put to him and the war by the young Cn. Pompey and Q. Metellus Pius, and almost all of Spain was brought under the control of the Roman people.

### Chapter 2

(1) Ap. Claudius was sent to Macedonia after his consulship. He had minor battles against various tribes who inhabited the province of Rhodope, and there he died of illness.

(2) His successor, C. Scribonius Curio, was sent after his consulship. He defeated the Dardani and penetrated as far as the Danube, earned a triumph, and within three years put an end to the war.

### Chapter 3: War with the Isaurians, 78 BCE

P. Servilius, a vigorous man, was sent to Cilicia and Pamphylia after his consulship. He subdued Cilicia, besieged and captured the most famous cities of Lycia, including Phaselis, Olympus, Corycus. He also attacked the Isaurians and brought them under control, and within three years put an end to the war. He was the first of all the Romans to make a journey in Taurus. On his return, he received a triumph and earned the name Isauricus.

### Chapter 4

C. Cosconius was sent to Illyricum as proconsul. He subdued a large part of Dalmatia, captured Salona, and after settling the war, returned to Rome after two years.

### Chapter 5

(1) At the same time, the consul M. Aemilius Lepidus, colleague of Catulus, wanted to stir up a civil war; however, his movement was suppressed within one summer.

(2) Thus, at one time, there were many triumphs at once: Metellus from Spain, Pompey's second from Spain, Curio's from Macedonia, Servilius's from Isauria.

### Chapter 6: The Third Mithridatic War, 74 – 63 BCE

(1) In the 676th year from the founding of the city, during the consulship of L. Licinius Lucullus and M. Aurelius Cotta, Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, died; and by his will, he made the Roman people his heir.

(2) Mithridates, breaking the peace, wanted to invade Bithynia and Asia again. Both consuls were sent against him and had varying fortunes. Cotta was defeated by him at Chalcedon, even forced within the town and besieged.

(3) But when Mithridates had moved from there to Cyzicus, in order to invade all of Asia by capturing Cyzicus, Lucullus, the other consul, met him. And, while Mithridates was lingering in the siege of Cyzicus, he himself besieged him from behind and consumed him with hunger and defeated him in many battles, finally drove him out of Byzantium, which is now Constantinople. Lucullus also crushed his commanders in a naval battle. Thus, in one winter and summer, nearly a hundred thousand of the king's men were wiped out by Lucullus.

### Chapter 7: War with the Gladiators, 73 – 71 BCE

(1) In the 678th year of the city of Rome, M. Licinius Lucullus, the cousin of Lucullus, who was waging war against Mithridates, took over the province of Macedonia.

(2) And in Italy, a new war suddenly broke out. For seventy-four gladiators, led by Spartacus, Crixus, and Oenomaus, broke out of the school at Capua and wandering through Italy, they almost prepared a war in it, no less serious than the one Hannibal had stirred up. For after many commanders and two Roman consuls at the same time had been defeated, they gathered an army of nearly sixty thousand armed men and were defeated in Apulia by M. Licinius Crassus, the proconsul, and after many disasters in Italy, an end was put to this war in the third year.

### Chapter 8

(1) In the 681st year from the founding of the city, during the consulship of P. Cornelius Lentulus and Cn. Aufidius Orestes, there were only two serious wars in the Roman empire, the Mithridatic and the Macedonian. The Luculli were handling these two, L. Lucullus and M. Lucullus.

(2) So L. Lucullus, after the battle of Cyzicus, in which he had defeated Mithridates, and the naval battle, in which he had crushed his commanders, pursued him and, having recovered Paphlagonia and Bithynia, even invaded his kingdom, captured Sinope and Amisus, the most famous cities of Pontus.

(3) In the second battle at the city of Cabira, where Mithridates had brought huge forces from his entire kingdom, when thirty thousand of the king's elite were destroyed by five thousand Romans, Mithridates was put to flight, his camp was plundered. Lesser Armenia, which he had held, was also taken away from him.

(4) However, Mithridates was received after his flight by Tigranes, king of Armenia, who was then ruling with great glory, had often defeated the Persians, had occupied Mesopotamia and Syria and part of Phoenicia.

### Chapter 9: Battle of Tigranocerta, 69 BCE

(1) Therefore, Lucullus, pursuing the fleeing enemy, also entered the kingdom of Tigranes, who ruled the Armenians. He captured Tigranocerta, the most famous city of the Armenian kingdom, in the region of Arzanene, defeated the king himself, who came with seven thousand five hundred cataphracts and a hundred thousand archers and armed men, having eighteen thousand soldiers, in such a way that he destroyed a large part of the Armenians. From there he went to Nisibis and also captured that city with the king's brother.

(2) But those whom Lucullus had left in Pontus with part of the army, to guard the regions that had been conquered and were now Roman, acting carelessly and greedily, gave Mithridates the opportunity to invade Pontus again and so the war was renewed. A successor was sent to Lucullus, who was preparing to lead an expedition against the Persians after capturing Nisibis.

### Chapter 10

The other Lucullus, who was administering Macedonia, first of the Romans waged war on the Bessi and defeated them in a huge battle on Mount Haemus. He conquered the town of Uscudama, which the Bessi inhabited, on the same day he attacked it, captured Cabyle, penetrated as far as the Danube. From there he attacked many cities located above Pontus. There he overthrew Apollonia, captured Callatis, Parthenopolis, Tomis, Histrus, Burzioen, and after completing the war, he returned to Rome. However, both triumphed, Lucullus, who had fought against Mithridates, with greater glory, since he had returned as the victor of such great kingdoms.

### Chapter 11

(1) After the Macedonian war was completed, the Mithridatic war remaining, which the king had revived after Lucullus's departure, the Cretan war arose.

(2) Q. Caecilius Metellus was sent to it, and within three years he captured the entire province and was called Creticus and triumphed from the island.

(3) At this time, Libya also came under Roman rule by the will of Apion, who had been its king, in which famous cities were Berenice, Ptolemais, Cyrene.

### Chapter 12: Cn. Pompey Takes Command

(1) While these things were happening, pirates were infesting all the seas so much that the Romans, victorious throughout the world, were not safe in navigation alone: therefore this war was decreed to Cn. Pompey. Which he accomplished within a few months with great fortune and speed.

(2) Soon the war against King Mithridates and Tigranes was also entrusted to him. Having undertaken this, he defeated Mithridates in Lesser Armenia in a night battle, plundered his camp, killed forty thousand of his men, lost only twenty from his own army and two centurions.

(3) Mithridates fled with his wife and two companions. Not much later, when he was raging against his own people, he was forced to death by the sedition of his son Pharnaces among the soldiers and drank poison. Mithridates met this end. However, he died near the Bosporus, a man of great industry and counsel. He reigned for sixty years, lived for seventy-two, and waged war against the Romans for forty years.

### Chapter 13

Then Pompey waged war on Tigranes. He surrendered to him and came to Pompey's camp sixteen miles from Artaxata and placed his diadem, after he had fallen to Pompey's knees, in his hands. Pompey replaced it for him and treated him honorably, however, he reduced a large part of his kingdom and a large amount of money. Syria, Phoenice, Sophanene, and six thousand talents of silver were taken from him, which he would give to the Roman people, because he had waged war on the Romans without cause.

### Chapter 14: Pompey Subdues Syria and Palestine, 64 BCE

(1) Soon Pompey also waged war on the Albani and defeated their king Orodes three times, finally by letters and gifts he asked for and gave him pardon and peace. He also defeated the king of Iberia, Artaces, in battle and accepted him in surrender. He gave Lesser Armenia to Deiotarus, the king of Galatia, because he had been an ally in the Mithridatic war. He returned Paphlagonia to Attalus and Pylaemenes. He installed Aristarchus as king of the Colchians. Soon he defeated the Ituraeans and Arabs.

(2) And when he had come to Syria, he granted freedom to the city of Seleucia, neighboring Antioch, because it had not received King Tigranes. He returned hostages to the Antiochenes. He gave some fields to the Daphnenses, so that the grove there would become more spacious, delighted by the pleasantness of the place and the abundance of waters. Then he crossed over to Judaea, took Jerusalem, the capital of the nation, in the third month with twelve thousand Jews killed, the rest accepted in good faith. After these deeds, he returned to Asia and put an end to the most ancient war.

Chapter 15: Cicero Consul. Conspiracy of Catiline, 63 BCE

In the consulship of M. Tullius Cicero the orator and C. Antonius, in the year from the founding of the city six hundred and eighty-nine, L. Sergius Catilina, a man of the noblest birth, but of the most depraved genius, conspired to destroy his country with some men who were famous indeed, but audacious. He was expelled from the city by Cicero. His associates, having been apprehended, were strangled in prison, by the other consul Antonius Catilina himself was defeated in battle and killed.

### Chapter 16: Triumphs of Metellus and Pompey, 62 BCE

In the six hundred and ninetieth year of the city, with D. Junius Silanus and L. Murena as consuls, Metellus triumphed over Crete, Pompey over the pirate and Mithridatic war. No triumphal procession was ever similar. The sons of Mithridates, the son of Tigranes and Aristobulus king of the Jews were led before his chariot; a huge amount of money was carried before and an infinite weight of gold and silver. At this time there was no serious war throughout the world.

### Chapter 17: Caesar Consul, 59 BCE. Governor of Gaul, 58 – 49 BCE

(1) In the year from the founding of the city six hundred and ninety-three, C. Julius Caesar, who later ruled, was made consul with L. Bibulus; Gaul and Illyricum were decreed to him with ten legions.

(2) He first defeated the Helvetians, who are now called Sequani, then advancing through very serious wars he proceeded as far as the British Ocean.

(3) However, he subdued almost all of Gaul in nine years, which is between the Alps, the Rhone River, the Rhine and the Ocean and extends in circumference to twice and thirty hundred thousand paces. He soon waged war on the Britons, to whom before him not even the name of the Romans was known, and having defeated them he made them tributaries having accepted hostages. He also imposed an annual tribute on Gaul in the name of four hundred sesterces, and having attacked the Germans across the Rhine he defeated them in very fierce battles. Among so many successes he fought badly three times, once in person among the Arverni and twice in Germany while absent; for his two legates Titurius and Aurunculeius were killed by ambush.

### Chapter 18: Battle of Carrae; M. Liciunius Crassus slain, 53 BCE

(1) Around the same time in the year from the founding of the city six hundred and ninety-seven, M. Licinius Crassus, the colleague of Cn. Pompey the Great, in his second consulship was sent against the Parthians and, when he had fought around Carrhae against omen and auspices, he was defeated by Surena, the general of King Orodes, and finally killed with his most illustrious and most excellent young son.

(2) The remnants of the army were saved by C. Cassius the quaestor, who restored the lost things with such virtue with a singular spirit, that returning he defeated the Persians across the Euphrates in frequent battles.

### Chapter 19: The Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, 49 – 45 BCE; Caesar Invades Italy, Pompey flees to Greece, 49 BCE

(1) From here now a civil war followed, to be detested and lamented, by which besides the calamities, which happened in the battles, also the fortune of the Roman people was changed.

(2) For Caesar, returning from Gaul victorious, began to demand another consulship and so, that it would be conferred on him without any doubt. He was contradicted by the consul Marcellus, by Bibulus, by Pompey, by Cato, and ordered to return to the city having dismissed his armies. Because of this injury he came against his country with an army from Ariminum, where he had gathered soldiers.

(3) The consuls with Pompey and the whole senate and all the nobility fled from the city and went to Greece. In Epirus, Macedonia, Achaia the senate prepared war against Caesar under the leadership of Pompey.

### Chapter 20: Caesar Crosses To Spain

(1) Caesar, having entered the empty city, made himself dictator, then sought the Spains. There he overcame Pompey's strongest and bravest armies with three generals, L. Afranius, M. Petreius, M. Varro.

(2) Then returning he crossed over to Greece, fought against Pompey. In the first battle he was defeated and put to flight, however, he escaped, because Pompey did not want to follow when night intervened, and Caesar said neither did Pompey know how to win and that only on that day could he have been overcome.

(3) Then in Thessaly at Palaeopharsalus with huge forces drawn up on both sides they fought. Pompey's line had forty thousand foot soldiers, six hundred horsemen on the left wing, five hundred on the right, besides the auxiliaries of the whole East, all the nobility, countless senators, praetorians, consulars and those who had already been victors of great wars. Caesar in his line had not quite thirty thousand foot soldiers, a thousand horsemen.

### Chapter 21: Battle of Pharsalus. Pompey is defeated, flees to Egypt, and is slain, 48 BCE

(1) Never yet had Roman troops in one place nor larger nor with better generals come together, easily about to subdue the whole world, if they were led against barbarians.

(2) However, a battle was fought with great contention and finally Pompey was defeated and his camp was plundered.

(3) He himself, having been put to flight, sought Alexandria, so that he would receive auxiliaries from the king of Egypt, to whom a guardian had been given by the senate because of his youthful age. Who, having followed fortune more than friendship, killed Pompey, sent his head and ring to Caesar. When he saw this, Caesar is said to have shed tears, looking at the head of such a great man and once his son-in-law.

### Chapter 22: Caesar Defeats Ptolemy

(1) Soon Caesar came to Alexandria. Ptolemy himself also wanted to prepare traps, for which reason war was waged on the king. He was defeated and perished in the Nile and his body was found with a golden breastplate.

(2) Caesar, having taken possession of Alexandria, gave the kingdom to Cleopatra, Ptolemy's sister, with whom he had had a sexual relationship. Returning from there, Caesar defeated Pharnaces, the son of Mithridates the Great, who had been an ally of Pompey in Thessaly, rebelling in Pontus and occupying many provinces of the Roman people in battle, afterwards he forced him to death.

### Chapter 23: Battle of Thapsus, 46 BCE

(1) From there Caesar returned to Rome and made himself consul for the third time with M. Aemilius Lepidus, who had been master of the horse to the dictator the year before. From there he set out for Africa, where infinite nobility had prepared war with Juba, king of Mauretania.

(2) However, the Roman leaders were P. Cornelius Scipio from the very ancient family of Scipio Africanus (he had also been Pompey's father-in-law), M. Petreius, Q. Varus, M. Porcius Cato, L. Cornelius Faustus, the son of Sulla the dictator.

(3) Against these, after many battles had been fought, Caesar was victorious. Cato, Scipio, Petreius, Juba themselves killed themselves. Faustus, the son of Sulla the former dictator, Pompey's son-in-law, was killed by Caesar.

### Chapter 24: Battle of Munda, 45 BCE

After a year Caesar returned to Rome and made himself consul for the fourth time and immediately set out for the Spains, where Pompey's sons, Cn. Pompey and Sextus Pompey, had prepared a huge war. Many battles were fought, the last one at the city of Munda, in which Caesar was almost defeated, so that when his men were fleeing he wanted to kill himself, lest after such great military glory he should come into the power of young men, being fifty-six years old. Finally, having rallied his men, he was victorious. The older of Pompey's sons was killed, the younger fled.

### Chapter 25: Caesar Monarch, 45 BCE. Caesar Assassinated, 44 BCE

From there Caesar, with civil wars settled throughout the world, returned to Rome. He began to act more arrogantly and against the custom of Roman liberty. Therefore, when he was conferring honors out of his own will, which were previously conferred by the people, and he did not rise to the senate coming to him, he did some things that were royal and almost tyrannical, a conspiracy was formed against him by sixty or more senators and Roman knights. The most prominent among the conspirators were two Brutuses from the family of Brutus, who had been the first consul in Rome and had expelled the kings, and C. Cassius and Servilius Casca. Therefore Caesar, when on the day of the senate among the others he had come to the curia, was stabbed with twenty-three wounds.

## Book 7

### Chapter 1: The rise of Octavian and the Battle of Mutina, 44–43 BCE

(1) In the approximately 709th year of the city, with Caesar having been killed, civil wars were renewed. For the Senate was favoring the assassins of Caesar, and Antony, the consul of the Caesarian party, was trying to oppress them with civil wars. Therefore, with the republic being disturbed, Antony, committing many crimes, was judged an enemy by the Senate.

(2) Two consuls, Pansa and Hirtius, and Octavian, a young man of 18 years, the nephew of Caesar, whom he had left as his heir in his will and had ordered to bear his name, were sent to pursue him. (This is the one who was later called Augustus and gained control of affairs.) Therefore, the three leaders who had set out against Antony defeated him. However, it happened that both victorious consuls died. Therefore, the three armies obeyed the one Caesar Augustus.

### Chapter 2: The Second Triumvirate, 43 BCE 

(1) Antony, having been routed and having lost his army, fled to Lepidus, who had been master of the horse to Caesar and then had large forces of soldiers, by whom he was received. Soon, with Lepidus lending his aid, Caesar made peace with Antony and, as if he were going to avenge the death of his father, by whom he had been adopted through his will, he set out to Rome with his army and extorted that the consulship be given to him in his twentieth year.

(2) He proscribed the Senate, began to hold the republic with Antony and Lepidus by means of arms. Through them also Cicero the orator was killed and many other nobles.

### Chapter 3: The Battle of Philippi, 42 BCE 

(1) Meanwhile, Brutus and Cassius, the assassins of Caesar, stirred up a huge war. For there were many armies through Macedonia and the East, which they had seized. Therefore, Caesar Octavian Augustus and M. Antony set out against them; for Lepidus had remained to defend Italy.

(2) They fought against them at the city of Philippi in Macedonia. In the first battle, Antony and Caesar were defeated, however, Cassius, the leader of the nobility, died, in the second, they killed Brutus and the infinite nobility, who had waged war with them.

(3) And thus the republic was divided among them, so that Augustus held Spain, Gaul, and Italy, Antony Asia, Pontus, the East.

(4) But in Italy L. Antony, consul, stirred up a civil war, his brother, who had fought with Caesar against Brutus and Cassius. He was defeated and captured at the city of Perusia in Tuscany, and was not killed.

### Chapter 4: War with Sextus Pompey 

Meanwhile, a huge war in Sicily was stirred up by Sex. Pompey, the son of Cn. Pompey the Great, with those who had survived from the parties of Brutus and Cassius flocking to him. War was waged against Sex. Pompey by Caesar Augustus Octavian and M. Antony. Peace finally agreed.

### Chapter 5 

At that time, M. Agrippa conducted affairs successfully in Aquitania and L. Ventidius Bassus, invading Syria, defeated the Persians in three battles. He killed Pacorus, the son of King Orodes, on that very day, on which once Orodes, king of the Persians, had killed Crassus through the leader Surenas. This man first celebrated a most just triumph at Rome over the Parthians.

### Chapter 6 

(1) Meanwhile, Pompey broke the peace and, having been defeated in a naval battle, fleeing to Asia, was killed. Antony, who was holding Asia and the East, having repudiated the sister of Caesar Augustus Octavian, married Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt.

(2) He also fought against the Persians. He defeated them in the first battles, however, returning, he suffered from hunger and disease and, with the Parthians pressing on him as he fled, he himself retreated as if defeated.

### Chapter 7: Civil War between Augustus and Antonius. The Battle of Actium, 31 BCE 

This man also stirred up a huge civil war, urged on by his wife Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt, while, with womanly desire, she hopes to reign even in the city. He was defeated by Augustus in a famous and illustrious naval battle at Actium, which place is in Epirus; from which he fled to Egypt and, with all hope lost, when everyone was going over to Augustus, he killed himself. Cleopatra admitted an asp to herself and was extinguished by its poison. Egypt was added to the Roman empire by Octavian Augustus and C. Cornelius Gallus was put in charge of it; this man was the first Roman judge that Egypt had.

### Chapter 8: Imperial Government Established, 31 BCE 

(1) Thus, with wars having been completed throughout the world, Octavian Augustus returned to Rome, in the twelfth year since he had been consul.

(2) From then, he held the republic alone for forty-four years; for before then, he had held it for twelve years with Antony and Lepidus.

(3) Thus, from the beginning of his principate up to the end, there were fifty-six years.

(4) He died, however, in the seventy-sixth year by a natural death in the town of Atella in Campania. He was buried at Rome in the Field of Mars, a man, who not undeservedly for the most part was thought similar to a god. For not easily was anyone more fortunate than he in wars or more moderate in peace. In the forty-four years, in which he alone conducted the empire, he lived most civilly, most generous towards all, most faithful towards his friends, whom he raised to such great honors, that he almost equaled them to his own position.

### Chapter 9: Extension of the Empire 

At no time before him did the Roman state flourish more; for except for civil wars, in which he was unconquered, he added to the Roman empire Egypt, Cantabria, Dalmatia, often before conquered, but then thoroughly subdued, Pannonia, Aquitania, Illyricum, Raetia, the Vindelici and the Salassi in the Alps, all maritime cities of Pontus, among these the most noble Bosporus and Panticapaeum. He also defeated the Dacians in battles. He killed huge forces of the Germans, he also moved them themselves beyond the river Albis, which is in Barbaricum far beyond the Rhine. However, he conducted this war through Drusus, his stepson (just as through Tiberius, his other stepson, the Pannonian); in which war he transferred forty thousand captives from Germany and placed them above the bank of the Rhine in Gaul. He recovered Armenia from the Parthians. The Persians, which no one before, gave him hostages. They also returned the Roman standards, which they had taken away when Crassus was defeated.

### Chapter 10: Death of Augustus, 14 CE 

(1) The Scythians and Indians, to whom the name of the Romans had been unknown before, sent gifts and ambassadors to him.

(2) Galatia also under this man was made a province, when before it had been a kingdom, and M. Lollius first administered it as propraetor.

(3) He was of such great love even among the barbarians, that kings, friends of the Roman people, in his honor founded cities, which they would call Caesareas, just as in Mauretania by King Juba and in Palestine, which now is a most famous city.

(4) Many kings also came from their kingdoms, so that they might pay their respects to him, and in Roman dress, togaed namely, they ran to his carriage or horse.

(5) Dying, he was called divine. He left the republic most blessed to Tiberius his successor, who had been his stepson, soon son-in-law, finally son by adoption.

### Chapter 11: Tiberius Emperor, 14 – 37 CE 

(1) Tiberius conducted the empire with great sluggishness, severe cruelty, wicked greed, shameful lust. For he himself never fought, he waged wars through his legates.

(2) He never sent back certain kings, whom he had called to himself through flattery, among whom Archelaus of Cappadocia, whose kingdom he also reduced into the form of a province and ordered that the greatest city be called by his name, which now is called Caesarea, when before it was called Mazaca. This man in the twenty-third year of his rule, in the seventy-eighth of his age, died with great joy of all in Campania.

### Chapter 12: Caligula Emperor, 47 – 41 CE 

(1) C. Caesar, known as Caligula, succeeded him. He was the stepson of Augustus and the grandson of Drusus and Tiberius himself. He was the most wicked and disastrous, who even purged the disgraces of Tiberius.

(2) He waged war against the Germans and entered Suebia, but did nothing strenuous.

(3) He violated his sisters, and even recognized a daughter born from one of them.

(4) As he raged against everyone with great greed, lust, and cruelty, he was killed in the Palace in the twenty-ninth year of his age, the third of his reign, in the tenth month and the eighth day.

### Chapter 13: Claudius Emperor, 41 – 54 CE 

(1) After him was Claudius, the uncle of Caligula, the son of Drusus who has a monument at Mogontiacum, and whose grandson was Caligula. He ruled moderately, doing many things calmly and moderately, some cruelly and foolishly.

(2) He waged war on Britain, which no Roman had touched since C. Caesar, and having conquered it through Cn. Sentius and A. Plautius, illustrious and noble men, he celebrated a famous triumph.

(3) He also added to the Roman empire certain islands beyond Britain located in the Ocean, which are called the Orkneys; he also imposed the name Britannicus on his son.

(4) However, he was so civil around certain friends that he even followed the triumphant Plautius, a noble man who had done many remarkable things in the British expedition, and walked on the left as he ascended the Capitol.

(5) He lived for 64 years, reigned for 14. After his death, he was consecrated and called a god.

### Chapter 14: Nero Emperor, 54 – 68 CE 

(1) Nero succeeded him, very similar to his uncle Caligula, who deformed and diminished the Roman empire, with unprecedented luxury and expenses, as one who bathed in hot and cold perfumes by the example of C. Caligula, fished with golden nets, which he drew out with silken ropes. He killed an infinite part of the senate, he was an enemy to all good men.

(2) Finally, he prostituted himself with such disgrace that he would both dance and sing on stage in a citharoedic or tragic costume. He committed many parricides, having killed his brother, wife, <sister,> mother. He set fire to the city of Rome, so that he could see the image of the spectacle, just as Troy had once burned.

(4) In military matters, he dared nothing at all and almost lost Britain. For under him two most noble towns were captured there and overthrown. The Parthians took Armenia and sent the Roman legions under the yoke.

(5) However, two provinces were made under him, Pontus Polemoniacus by the concession of King Polemon and the Alps Cottiae by the death of King Cottius.

### Chapter 15 

(1) Through these things, he was detested by all in the Roman world and was judged an enemy by the senate; when they sought him for punishment, which punishment was such that he would be led naked through the public, with a fork inserted into his head, beaten with rods until death, and then thrown down from a rock, he fled from the Palace and killed himself in a suburban area of his freedman, which is between the Salarian and Nomentan roads, at the fourth mile of the city.

(2) He built baths in Rome, which were previously called Neronianae and are now called Alexandrianae.

(3) He died in the thirty-second year of his age, the fourteenth of his reign, and in it all the family of Augustus was consumed.

### Chapter 16: Galba Emperor, 68 – 69 CE 

(1) Ser. Galba succeeded him, a senator of the most ancient nobility, when he was in the seventy-third year of his age, elected emperor by the Spaniards and Gauls, soon willingly accepted by the entire army.

(2) For his private life had been distinguished in military and civil matters; often consul, often proconsul, frequently a leader in the most serious wars. His reign was brief and would have had good beginnings, unless he seemed more inclined to severity.

(3) However, he was killed by the treachery of Otho in the seventh month of his reign. He was slain in the forum of Rome and buried in his gardens, which are on the Aurelian Way not far from the city of Rome.

### Chapter 17: Otho Emperor, 69 CE 

(1) Otho, after killing Galba, seized the empire, more noble on his mother's side than his father's, but neither was obscure.

(2) In private life he was soft and familiar with Nero, in the empire he could not show a proof of himself.

(3) For at the same times, when Otho had killed Galba, Vitellius had also been made emperor by the Germanic armies, having undertaken war against him, when he had been defeated in a light battle at Bedriacum in Italy, although he had huge forces for war, he killed himself voluntarily. When the soldiers asked him not to despair so quickly about the outcome of the war, since he was not so important that a civil war should be moved on his account, he died a voluntary death in the thirty-eighth year of his age, the ninety-fifth day of his reign.

### Chapter 18: Vitellius Emperor, 69 CE 

(1) Then Vitellius seized power, from a family more honored than noble. For his father, not very nobly born, had nevertheless held three ordinary consulships.

(2) He ruled with much disgrace and was notable for severe cruelty, especially gluttony and voracity, as he is often reported to have feasted four or five times a day.

(3) A certain dinner is most notably committed to memory, which his brother Vitellius presented to him, in which two thousand fish and seven birds are reported to have been served, over and above the other expenses.

(4) He, wanting to be like Nero and even boasting about it, so that he even honored the funeral rites of Nero, which had been humbly buried, was killed by Vespasian's generals after first killing Sabinus, the brother of Emperor Vespasian, in the city, whom he burned with the Capitol.

(5) However, he was killed with great disgrace: dragged through the city of Rome publicly, naked, with his hair standing on end and a sword placed under his chin, attacked by everyone he met with filth on his face and chest, finally his throat was cut and he was thrown into the Tiber, he even lacked a common burial.

(6) He died in the seventh and fiftieth year of his age, the eighth month and one day of his reign.

### Chapter 19: Vespasian Emperor, 69 – 79 CE 

(1) Vespasian succeeded him, made emperor in Palestine, a prince indeed obscurely born, but to be compared to the best, illustrious in private life, as one who had been sent by Claudius to Germany and then to Britain, had fought with the enemy thirty-two times, added two very strong nations, twenty towns, the island of Vectis, nearest to Britain, to the Roman empire.

(2) In Rome, he conducted himself most moderately in power. He was only greedier for money, so that he would not take it unjustly from anyone. Although he collected it with all the provision of diligence, he was nevertheless most generously lavish, especially to the needy. Neither before him was any prince's generosity or justice more easily discovered. Of the most placid leniency, as one who would not easily punish those accused of treason against him beyond the penalty of exile.

(3) Under him, Judea was added to the Roman empire and Jerusalem, which was the most noble city of Palestine.

(4) He reduced Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, Byzantium, Samos, which had been free before that time, also Thrace, Cilicia, Commagene, which had been under friendly kings, to the form of provinces.

### Chapter 20 

(1) He was forgetful of offenses and enmities, he took insults from lawyers and philosophers spoken against him leniently, however, he was a diligent enforcer of military discipline.

(2) He triumphed with his son Titus over Jerusalem. Through these things, he was beloved and pleasant to the senate, the people, finally to all, he died of a bowel flow in his own villa near the Sabines, being sixty-nine years old, nine years and seven days of his reign, and was counted among the gods.

(3) He had such knowledge of the birth of his sons, that, when many conspiracies were made against him, which he despised with great dissimulation when they were revealed, he said in the senate either his sons would succeed him or no one.

### Chapter 21: Titus Emperor, 79 – 81 CE 

(1) His son Titus succeeded him, who was also called Vespasian, a man admirable in every kind of virtue, so much so that he was called "the love and delight of the human race", most eloquent, most warlike, most moderate. He pleaded cases in Latin, composed poems and tragedies in Greek.

(2) In the siege of Jerusalem, serving under his father, he hit twelve defenders with twelve arrow shots. In Rome, he was of such civility in power, that he did not punish anyone at all, he dismissed those convicted of conspiracy against him or kept them in the same familiarity as before.

(3) He was of such facility and liberality, that, when he denied nothing to anyone and was reproached by his friends, he replied that no one should leave the emperor sad; moreover, when one day at dinner he remembered that he had not granted anything to anyone that day, he said: "Friends, today I have lost the day."

(4) He built an amphitheater in Rome and killed five thousand beasts at its dedication.

### Chapter 22 

(1) Through these things, loved with unusual favor, he died of disease in the same villa as his father, two years and eight months, twenty days after he was made emperor, in the forty-second year of his age.

(2) Such public mourning was there when he died, that everyone mourned as if in their own bereavement. The senate, with his death announced around evening, broke into the curia at night and heaped such praises and thanks on him after he died, as much as they had never done to him alive or present. He was counted among the gods.

### Chapter 23: Domitian Emperor, 81 – 96 CE 

(1) Domitian soon took power, his younger brother, more like Nero or Caligula or Tiberius than his father or his brother. However, he was moderate in power in the first years, then he progressed to huge vices of lust, anger, cruelty, greed, he stirred up so much hatred in himself, that he would abolish the merits of his father and brother.

(2) He killed the most noble from the senate. He was the first to order himself to be called lord and god. He allowed no statue of himself to be placed in the Capitol except gold and silver.

(3) He killed his cousins. His pride was also detestable.

(4) He had four expeditions, one against the Sarmatians, another against the Chatti, two against the Dacians. He celebrated a double triumph over the Dacians and Chatti, he usurped only the laurel over the Sarmatians. However, he suffered many disasters in the same wars; for in Sarmatia his legion with its leader was killed by the Dacians, Oppius Sabinus, a consular, and Cornelius Fuscus, prefect of the praetorium, were killed with large armies.

(5) He also did many works in Rome, among these the Capitol and the Forum Transitorium, the Portico of the Divi, the Iseum and Serapeum and the Stadium.

(6) But when he began to be hated by all because of his crimes, he was killed by a conspiracy of his own in the Palace, in the forty-fifth year of his age, the fifteenth of his reign. His funeral was carried out with great disgrace by undertakers and he was ignobly buried.
