## Preface

*By Christopher Francese*

This edition of Eutropius is intended for readers of Latin. No full translation is provided, although potentially difficult phrases are translated in the notes. The Latin text conforms to that of B. Bleckmann and J. Groß, Eutropius: Breviarium ab urbe condita (Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöningh, 2018), with the addition of macrons on all long vowels, and occasional slight changes in punctuation and orthography. 

The historical notes draw on the excellent English translation with notes by H.W. Bird, Eutropius: Breviarium (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2011, orig. 1993), and on the old school edition of J.C. Hazzard, Eutropius Edited for School Use (New York: American Book Company, 1898). The edition of Fabrizio Bordone, Eutropio: Storia di Roma (Santarcangelo di Romagna: Rusconi Libri, 2014) was also consulted. These editors are credited in the notes themselves as appropriate. 

Kristin Masters wrote an introduction and original notes on grammatical and cultural matters; she selected and edited notes from the editions of Bird and Hazzard; she selected and translated parallel passages from other ancient authors; and she added many hyperlinks to Allen and Greenough’s Latin Grammar (for points of Latin grammar), Logeion (for lexical matters), Wikipedia (for historical persons), Pleiades (for ancient places), and to translated versions of parallel ancient texts in ToposText or the Perseus Digital Library. 

Several Dickinson students made important contributions. Nicholas Morris ('24) wrote an essay on Eutropius' historiographical aims, and a guide to the dating systems employed in the work. Claire Jeantheau (’19) created the web pages in Drupal. Drew Kaplan (‘20) read and critiqued the notes for Books 8–10. Nicholas Morris (’24), Jocelyn Wright (’23), Jack Tigani (‘22), and Ivy Johnson (’24) read and critiqued the notes, edited the vocabulary lists (see below) and translated some parallel texts included in the notes. A full list of contributors can be found on the credits page.

The genesis of the vocabulary lists was briefly as follows. I began by having professionally digitized A.H. Moser’s Index Verborum Eutropianus (Ph.D. Thesis, New York University, 1931) and Hazzard’s edition of Eutropius, which includes a full vocabulary. Moser’s Index provides full citations by Book and chapter for all examples of every dictionary headword (lemma) in the text. For our purposes, Moser’s alphabetical list of lemmas and citations needed to be converted into a list of lemmas ordered by citation, i.e., by Book and chapter of Eutropius. Michael Skalak of Dickinson’s Computer Science Department performed that operation using Java. (For other efforts to convert old print concordances into lemmatized digital texts, see the Concordance Liberation Project). 

Once Moser’s data was in sortable spreadsheet, Hazzard’s display lemmas and definitions were added. Location-sorted lists were further processed by Patrick Burns using Python to approximate the running order. Dickinson students Jack Tigani (‘22), Jocelyn Wright (’23), Ivy Johnson (’24), and Nicholas Morris (’24), edited and refined the lists to make sure they were in proper running order. In final editing I refined some of the definitions to modernize and clarify the English.

Funding for the digitization of Moser and Hazzard, and to hire student workers during school breaks, came from the Roberts Fund for Classical Studies at Dickinson College. 

I am most grateful to all the contributors for making possible what I am confident will be a useful resource for all students of Latin. I hope in coming years to add images, custom maps, and audio recordings.

## Introduction

Eutropius’ Breviarium ab urbe condita is a summary of Roman history from the founding of Rome (traditionally set at 753 BCE) to the reign of the emperor Jovian (364 CE). It was dedicated to the reigning emperor, Valens (r. 364–378), and aimed to collect “the conspicuous achievements of the Romans, whether in war or in peace … [as well as] those topics which appeared exceptional in the lives of the emperors” (Breviarium, Preface). 

Little is known of Eutropius’ life, beyond a few details mentioned in the Breviarium. He says he participated in the expedition to fight the Parthians mounted by the Emperor Julian (363 CE, see Brev. 10.16.1), though what role he played is unknown. The work’s dedication seems to refer to Eutropius as Valens’ magister memoriae. This was very high position in the Roman imperial bureaucracy, in the office of legal advisors to the emperor, subordinate to the magister officiorum. The duties of the office included composing replies to petitions made to the emperor. H.W. Bird argues, citing Ammianus Marcellinus, that Eutropius served as proconsul of the Roman province of Asia under Valens (Eutropius Asiam proconsulari tunc obtinens potestate, Ammianus, Histories 29.1.36; Bird 2011: xiv), a very responsible position indeed, with direct access to the emperor. 

Because of its important content and straightforward style, Eutropius’ work became a classroom staple in ancient times, and has remained so. A Greek translation was made by a certain Paeanius already in Eutropius’ lifetime for the Greek-speaking readership of the empire. The Breviarium has a rich Latin manuscript tradition, with surviving examples as early as the 9th century, such as the important manuscript known as “G,” from Gotha (Gothanus 101). The fact that Eutropius' compendium had nine print editions before the year 1800, with four editions needing a second reprint, shows strong demand  for the work in the early modern era. This edition draws on some of the earlier ones, especially the recent English translation of H.W. Bird (Eutropius: Breviarium, Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1993, new ed. 2011), and the school edition of J.C. Hazzard (Eutropius Edited for School Use, New York: American Book Company, 1898). 

With so much ground to cover, Eutropius was ruthlessly selective. He focuses on military matters and building programs, but occasionally adds a character-revealing anecdote as a garnish. His selection of events and occasional comments show that he considered military success a key attribute of a good leader. In seventy or so (modern) pages of text, Eutropius mentions no fewer that sixty-five “triumphs,” that characteristically Roman post-war victory celebration. For those interested in further details about events mentioned only in passing by Eutropius, this edition provides many references to other ancient sources. Here is an annotated list of the ancient authors most often cited. 

- Ammianus Marcellinus, History (Res Gestae)

The History of Ammianus Marcellinus covers the reign of the emperors Constantius Gallus to the defeat of Valens at the Battle of Adrianople in 378 CE. Originally thirty-four volumes long, only eighteen volumes remain. This work provides particularly valuable information on Roman history and culture of the 4th century CE.

- Appian, Roman History

Appian was a Greek historian who lived during the 2nd century CE. His volumes of Roman history recount various foreign and civil wars. His account of Hannibal’s invasion during the Second Punic War was used in this commentary. 

- Augustus, Deeds of the Divine Augustus 

Augustus was a 1st century BCE Roman emperor who successfully converted the Roman government to a monarchy. His autobiography, the Deeds of the Divine Augustus, offer insight into his rule and is used in this commentary to provide clarification on Eutropius’ text.

- Cassius Dio, Roman History 

Cassius Dio wrote an eighty-volume work on Roman history that spans from Aeneas’ flight from Troy to the rise of Severus Alexander. Only fragments remain of the earlier portion of the work. 

- Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities

Dionysius of Halicarnassus was a Greek author who lived during the 1st century BCE. His work, the Roman Antiquities, is a twenty-volume work on Roman history that spans from the flight of Aeneas from Troy to the war against Pyrrhus in the 3rd century BCE. Many of the later books are lost, but his work is invaluable in preserving early Roman history and legends. 

- Anon., Epitome de Caesaribus

Although the Epitome de Caesaribus was originally thought to have been written by Sextus Aurelius Victor, this work is distinctly different from Aurelius’ work de Caesaribus. The Epitome gives an abbreviated history of the Roman emperors from Augustus to Theodosius. Parallel passages are used in this commentary that provide useful information and anecdotes on the lives of later Roman emperors.

- Florus, Epitome of Roman History

Florus abridged the works of Livy into two concise volumes in his Epitome. This work spans over seven hundred years, from the founding of the city by Romulus to the establishment of the Principate by Augustus.  

- Anon., Historia Augusta 

The Historia Augusta were a collection of imperial biographies that span the reigns of Hadrian to Carus. Although it is written in the style of Suetonius, much of the information in these biographies is not credible. Anecdotes were used in this commentary for illustrative purposes only. 

- Horace, Odes

Horace was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of the Emperor Augustus. He is most known for his famous line, “carpe diem” (Carm. I.11). His poetry is a rich source of Roman history and culture; this commentary uses his account of the First Punic War hero Regulus to complement Eutropius’ account. 

- Jordanes, Origin and Deeds of the Goths

Jordanes was a 6th century Roman author whose work, the Getica (Origin and Deeds of the Goths), preserves the migration and settlement of the various Gothic tribes into Roman territory. This text is particularly helpful in understanding the reigns of later Roman emperors. 

- Julius Caesar, De Bello Civili

Julius Caesar’s firsthand account of the Gallic and civil wars which he led.

- Lactantius, On the Deaths of the Persecutors

Lactantius is a 3rd century Latin Christian author who was part of the Roman Emperor Constantine’s royal court. His work, On the Deaths of the Persecutors, preserves the famous anecdote of Constantine’s religious vision and subsequent divine intervention that occurred during the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 CE.

- Livy, History of Rome

Considered one of the greatest Roman historians, Livy wrote the history of Rome from Aeneas’ flight from Troy to the rise of Augustus in 142 volumes. Although much of it only exists in fragments, the Romans valued it for its informative and didactic qualities.

- Marcus Aurelius. Meditations

Marcus Aurelius was a 2nd century CE Roman emperor known for his Stoic beliefs. The first volume of his journal, the Meditations, provides insight into the upbringing and education of a royal prince. Passages from the Meditations are used to supplement Eutropius’ information on the crucial figures in the emperor’s early life. 

- Pliny the Younger, Letters 

Pliny the Younger was a 2nd century Roman bureaucrat whose collected correspondence provides insight into Roman history and mores during the reign of Trajan. This commentary uses the famous “Christian Letter” to highlight the administrative mind of the emperor Trajan. 

- Plutarch, Parallel Lives

Plutarch was Greek author who lived during the end of the 1st century CE. His most famous work, the Parallel Lives, are a series of biographies of famous Greek and Roman statesmen. 

- Suetonius, Lives of the Caesars

Suetonius was a Roman historian who lived during the 2nd century CE. His most notable work, the Lives of the Caesars, was a series of imperial biographies that preserved the history of emperors Augustus through Domitian. 

- Tacitus, Annals and  Histories

Tacitus was a 2nd century CE Roman author who is most known for his works the Annals and the Histories. Only portions of the Annals remain, but its intended scope was the Julio-Claudian dynasty. His much shorter work, the Histories, covers the tumultuous Year of the Four Emperors and the Flavian dynasty.  Selections from the Annals and Histories were used in this commentary to provide context for the fall of Nero and its turbulent aftermath. 

- Valerius Maximus, Memorable Deeds and Sayings

Valerius Maximus was a Roman author who lived during the 1st century CE. His work, the Memorable Deeds and Sayings, were a collection of exempla and anecdotes for use in oratory. 

- Velleius Paterculus, History of Rome 

Writing a generation after Livy, Velleius Paterculus wrote a history of Rome from Aeneas’ flight from Troy to the ascension of the emperor Tiberius in two concise volumes. 

- Vergil, Aeneid

Written as a national epic in the 1st century BCE, Vergil’s Aeneid is considered the pinnacle of Roman literature. This commentary uses the depiction of the Battle of Actium on Aeneas’ shield in Book VIII for illustrative purposes.

- Zosimus, New Histories

Zosimus was a Greek author who lived during the 6th century CE. His work, the New Histories, covers the reigns of the emperors Augustus to the fall of Priscus Attalus. This commentary uses parallel passages of Zosimus regarding the emperors Aurelian and Constantine I.

## Eutropius's Aims

*By Nicholas Morris*

Eutropius wrote the Breviarium in the first instance for the emperor Valens, who took power over the eastern half of the Roman Empire in 364 CE, named co-emperor by his brother Valentinian I, who ruled in the West. The brothers were born to an Illyrian family in the province of Pannonia Secunda, and had served in military posts in various parts of the Empire. Valens, like many army officers and influential provincials of this period, lacked a strong understanding of Roman history. He tasked Eutropius with writing an account of the last thousand years of history that would be “simple, succinct and readable” enough for the emperor and his administration to perform their duties adequately (Bird 2011: xix). 

Eutropius was not an inexperienced bureaucrat. Prior service under the emperors Constantius II (337–361), Julian (361–363), and Jovian (363–364) (according to the reconstruction by Bird 2011: ix–xiii) meant that Eutropius had a good understanding of the empire’s problems. He likely saw writing the Breviarium as an opportunity to influence the actions of Valens and his administration, prodding them towards solutions to the problems Eutropius himself thought needed solving. The two most important issues to which Eutropius draws the emperor’s attention were Roman relations with their Persian neighbors and the relationship between the imperial throne and the senatorial aristocracy. 

The Sassanid (or Sassanian) dynasty in Persia was one of the most powerful opponents the later Roman Empire faced. Led by their sovereign Ardashir, they toppled their Parthian overlords in the mid-220s CE and took control of Persia. The Sassanids’ goal of reconquering all the land once held by their Achaemenid forebears brought them into sustained conflict with the Roman Empire for the next century and a half.  

In an ill-fated campaign against the Sassanids in 363 CE, the Roman emperor Julian died in battle and his bodyguard Jovian was hailed as the new emperor by their troops (Brev. 10.16–17). Pressed into an unfavorable position, Jovian opted to make peace with the Sassanids rather than to prolong an untenable war. The resulting treaty ended up being particularly disadvantageous for the Romans, who were forced to concede “the great fortresses of Nisibis, Singara and Castra Maurorum in Mesopotamia and the five provinces and fifteen fortresses beyond the Tigris” (Bird 2011: xviii). The neighboring kingdom of Armenia became a battleground between the two superpowers when the Sassanids tried to oust the pro-Roman client kings and to install their own puppet rulers there (Bird 2011: xix).  Even though Jovian had put a stop to a potentially disastrous war, Eutropius saw the treaty as a humiliating disgrace for the empire (Brev. 10.17). 

Eutropius, as one of the treaty’s opponents, believed that Rome should launch a punitive campaign against Persia to reconquer their relinquished lands. With Jovian’s death just seven months after his accession to power and the subsequent rise of Valens,  Eutropius may have recognized a chance to leave an imprint on the new emperor with the contents of his Breviarium.  

Eutropius gives special attention to the wars that Rome waged against the various eastern kingdoms, particularly against the Parthians and the Armenians. Before the Romans ever set foot in the East, however, they fought three destructive wars against the famed maritime power of Carthage, and describing these fit well in Eutropius’ hawkish rhetoric. The Second Punic War, to which Eutropius devotes most of Book Three, represents a prime instance of Roman valor and tenacity, as they struggled against Hannibal Barca, who proved to be a significant challenge for the Romans to overcome. Eutropius’ purpose may well be to show Valens that the Roman people had faced worse odds even before they first encountered the eastern kingdoms, and that if they could succeed against the likes of Hannibal and Carthage, they could do the same against Shapur and Persia. 

Eutropius chronicles Rome’s first steps into the East with their victories against the Seleucid Empire shortly after the turn of the second century BCE. He recounts all three Mithridatic Wars (Brev. 5.4–5.9, 6.6–6.12), as well as the disastrous defeat of Marcus Crassus at Carrhae in 53 BCE (Brev. 6.18) and the subsequent revenge campaign under Augustus and Agrippa (Brev. 7.9). Parthia is not mentioned again until their invasion of the East under Nero’s watch, when  the Parthians sent the defeated Roman legions under the yoke, a humiliating punishment (Brev. 7.14). 

The success of the emperor-general Trajan played a significant part in Eutropius’ articulation of his ideals. Like many in his time, Eutropius viewed Trajan very favorably. He praises Trajan’s successful campaigns against the Parthian Empire and his subsequent institution of three provinces in Mesopotamia and Armenia (Brev. 8.3). Under Trajan, the empire’s eastern reach stretched as far as the Persian Gulf. Eutropius’ admiration for Trajan matches his disgust for Trajan’s successor Hadrian, who ordered the removal of troops from the new Eastern provinces on account of insufficient resources (Brev. 8.6).  

After Trajan’s reign, Eutropius does not focus as much on Parthia’s activities.  But he returns to his discussion of the East during the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284 CE). The emperors Alexander Severus and Gordian III launched successful military expeditions against the Sassanids, who by now had supplanted the Parthians as the regional superpower; both men were later assassinated by their own soldiers (Brev. 8.23, 9.2). (From Gordian onwards, Eutropius increasingly uses the name “Parthians” in reference to the Persians, even though the former dynasty had been long overthrown.) This same fortune did not extend to Valerian, who was captured in battle by Shapur I and “grew old in ignominious servitude” (Brev. 9.7). Eutropius declines to go into detail in his discussion of this tragedy. Under Valerian’s son Gallienus the Persians again began to menace Roman Syria, but Eutropius notes that the East was saved under the client king Odenathus of Palmyra, who successfully staved off Shapur’s devastating assault. Palmyra would eventually secede from Rome under Zenobia, but would be reclaimed later by Aurelian (Brev. 9.8, 9.10, 9.13). 

Eutropius details the eastern campaigns of later emperors in Books Nine and Ten. Carus managed to penetrate as far as the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon before being killed by a lightning strike (Brev. 9.18). Galerius suffered initial setbacks while defending against an invasion by the Persian king Narses but emerged victorious in the end (Brev. 9.24–9.25). Constantine had reportedly been planning a counterattack against the Persians before his sudden death. His son Constantius II “suffered many serious setbacks at the hands of the Persians” (Brev. 10.10). Eutropius ends his history with the tale of Julian’s failed invasion of Persia and Jovian’s “necessary but shameful peace” (Brev. 10.17). 

Eutropius clarifies his intense opposition to the treaty because of its explicit surrender of Roman territory to the enemy, something that he asserts had never happened with previous generations of Romans, who preferred to keep fighting rather than admit defeat. This treaty would have  been more endurable had Jovian shown an intention to recapture the lost territory. Eutropius claims that the late emperor had an “insufficient concern for his reputation” (Brev. 10.17). 

In Valens, Eutropius saw a general most qualified to march against the Persians and reclaim the territory Jovian had surrendered. His focus, therefore, on Rome’s numerous encounters with Persia illustrates a near-unbroken string of Roman successes in the East, a record blemished by Jovian’s actions. Here Eutropius had an opportunity to encourage Valens to write his own name on the list of generals successful against the Sassanids. 

In addition to his focus on the Eastern empire, Eutropius also focuses on relationships between the emperors and the senatorial aristocracy. By the 360s the Senate as an institution had existed for over a millennium. Founded by Romulus as an advisory body for the kings, the Senate had retained that role in the nascent Republic. With Caesar’s civil war and the subsequent accession of Augustus in 27 BCE, the Senate lost a good deal of its power, but retained its prestige as a hallowed institution of Rome.  

Although true power lay with the emperors, the Senate’s nominal position and authority remained unchallenged, with emperors frequently making a show of deference to senatorial authority to show that they, too, were bound by convention and custom. It also became a common practice for the Senate to formally ratify the accession of the emperors, as though they wanted to prove that they still had an important role to play in the new imperial administration.  

But the crisis of the third century, which began with the death of Alexander Severus in 235 CE, would bring the senate’s authority crumbling down. Maximinus Thrax was the first emperor to rule without senatorial approval, having power conferred upon him by the legions (Brev. 9.1). This practice would continue for the next five decades until the Crisis was brought to a halt with the accession of the emperor Diocletian, whose rejection of the premise of senatorial authority paved the way for a more authoritarian style of rule.  

As a member of the senatorial class by virtue of his office-holding background, Eutropius tried to justify the importance of that class to the emperor. Valens’ brother and co-emperor Valentinian despised the senatorial elite, preferring to fill key administrative posts in Rome with associates or tried and trusted professionals. Conflicts over such issues led to many trials and even executions of senators. Eutropius, though a favorite of Valens, used the Breviarium to impress upon the emperor the importance of the Senate in Roman politics (Bird 2011: xxv-xxvi). He paints the Senate as a hallowed institution, wisely entrusted with its power throughout the centuries, and focusing little on its flaws.  

As a supporter of senatorial power, Eutropius is very selective in his portrayal of populist reformers in Late Republican politics. He completely omits a discussion of the brothers Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, tribunes of the plebs who sought redistribution of Rome’s extensive public land holdings to benefit landless citizens. Bird argues that Eutropius’ omission of the Gracchi from his chronicle was entirely intentional, as the Gracchi brothers and their exploits had been well-documented in later sources to which Eutropius would certainly have had access (Bird 2011: xxvii).  

Eutropius does mention other important populists such as Gaius Marius and Julius Caesar, but he treats their characters with relative disdain while uplifting the likes of Sulla and Pompey, the self-styled champions of the Senate (Brev. 4.27–5.9, 6.12–6.25). Marius, one of the most influential men of his day, is relegated to the role of an insignificant and annoying antagonist, whose military reforms, a crucial step in the evolution of the Roman army, are  not mentioned in Eutropius’ writing. By comparison, Sulla’s exploits in the East against Mithridates are explored in detail, more so than Marius’ equally important commands in the Jugurthine and Cimbric Wars.  

Eutropius appears to have somewhat more respect for Caesar. He includes the famous anecdote of Caesar’s grief at the death of his rival Pompey, as well as his praise of Caesar as being one of the two great generals at the Battle of Pharsalus (Brev. 6.21). Even so, Eutropius laments the division between Caesar and Pompey as a travesty for the Republic, claiming that the vast number of Roman troops under their combined command would have been better directed against external enemies rather than internal ones. In Eutropius’ eyes, the civil war was a useless and futile endeavor, best avoided if Caesar had simply laid down his command at the Senate’s behest.  

Furthermore, Eutropius seeks to influence the way Valens would treat the senatorial class by attempting to draw a clear correlation between an emperor’s successful rule and the quality of his relations with the Senate. The “good” emperors, such as Titus and Trajan, were merciful and generous, and refused to treat the senatorial elite with anything less than respect and deference (Brev. 7.21–7.22, 8.4–8.5). They accordingly enjoyed long and prosperous reigns unless disease or death in battle cut their reigns short. 

The “bad” emperors, on the other hand, such as Nero, Domitian, and Commodus, regularly ignored the Senate’s  advice and frequently condemned its members to death (Brev. 7.15, 7.23, 8.15). They were thus the subjects of many plots. And ultimately, they were the victims of assassination attempts. 

Eutropius’ selection of the historical events reflects his intention to influence the actions of Valens both in his dealings with the senatorial aristocracy and in his approach to the East. By focusing mostly on the positive actions of the Senate, Eutropius hopes to counteract the potential influence of Valens’ brother Valentinian and secure his own status within the social hierarchy of the Roman Empire. And by praising the emperors, who had successful campaigns in the East, Eutropius hopes to convince Valens to add his name to the list of emperors who have led successful campaigns against Persia.   

## Dating Systems Used by Eutropius

*By Nicholas Morris*

Eutropius specifies dates in several ways (see Bird 2011: liii). Usually, he uses one style at a time, though sometimes he will give a single date in more than one style, presumably to emphasize its importance. This guide covers the most frequent dating styles which Eutropius uses. 

A.U.C. dating: A.U.C. is short for ab urbe condita, “from the foundation of the city.” Eutropius follows his sources in his use of the date proposed by the scholar M. Terentius Varro: April 21st, 753 BCE. This is one of the most frequently used styles in Eutropius’ writing, the other being according to the list of consuls. There are certain sections of the Breviarium, however, where Eutropius is incorrect in his calculations. These will be indicated in the notes. 

Consular dating: The Roman Republic was led by two chief magistrates known as consuls. Since a consul’s term of office only lasted for a year, the Romans used the records of successive consulships as a means of keeping track of time. These records were compiled in a master list known as the fasti consulares. While the consulship was retained as a magistracy in the imperial bureaucracy, Eutropius’ use of consular dating is almost exclusively reserved for his account of the Republic, and it is mentioned only twice after the accession of Augustus: the accession of Nerva in section 8.1 and the death of Jovian in section 10.18. Bird conjectures that the former instance is an attempt to flatter the emperor Valens, as the emperor apparently shared his name with one of the consuls for 96 CE (Bird 2011: liv). The latter listing of Jovian and his infant son as the consuls for 364 CE does not appear to have any deeper significance. 

Imperial/Regal dating: Beginning with Augustus, Eutropius gives a timeline for the reigns of the emperors, providing the length of time between each emperor’s accession to power and his death (or abdication, in the case of Diocletian). Some helpful dates to remember are as follows: the accession of Augustus in 27 BCE, the death of Marcus Aurelius in 180 CE, and the accession of Diocletian in 284 CE. Eutropius keeps this same practice when he discusses the kings: for example, Romulus died after ruling thirty-seven years, Numa Pompilius died after ruling forty-three years, etc. 

In several sections that detail the early Republic (1.9-15), Eutropius will begin each one with the phrase annō... ab expulsīs rēgibus (“in the nth year from the expulsion of the kings”). Eutropius claims that the Roman monarchy lasted for two hundred and forty-three years. Taking the foundation date of 753 and subtracting from it the length of the regal period, we end up with a sum of five hundred ten; thus, Tarquinius Superbus was overthrown in 510 BCE. From this point onwards, the Republic was formed, and Eutropius will give the date accordingly from the fasti consulares. 

Calendar dating: In several places, Eutropius gives the dates according to the Roman calendar. Each month of the calendar has three specific days: the Kalends, the first day, the Nones, the fifth or seventh day (depending on the month), and the Ides, the thirteenth or fifteenth day (depending on the month). In order to calculate the date, take the number of days given in Roman numerals and go backwards that number from either the Kalends, Nones, or the Ides. We will use section 1.1 as an example. Eutropius gives the date of Rome’s founding as XI Kal. Māiās. The Kalends is the first day of May, so counting backwards eleven days from May 1st leads to April 21st. 

Other styles of dating: Eutropius also uses some dating styles which he does not use anywhere else in the Breviarium.  

In section 1.1, Eutropius not only uses the standard calendar date of Rome’s founding, but also includes the Olympiad, a four-year cycle beginning in 776 BCE, as well as the time since the alleged destruction of Troy. Traditional Roman mythology held that Rome’s first king Romulus was descended from the Trojan prince Aeneas, who had led the tattered remnants of his people to Italy and built a new kingdom there. The Olympics also held pagan associations for many Christians, and were banned by Emperor Theodosius I in 393 CE. Eutropius was possibly a pagan himself, and the inclusion of these two dating methods may thus have been Eutropius’ subtle attempt to preserve and justify his polytheistic faith and identity in an increasingly Christianized world. 

Two instances have to do with Carthage specifically. In section 4.10, Eutropius calculates that the Third Punic War begins about fifty-one years from the end of the Second. Furthermore, in section 4.12, the razing of Carthage, according to Eutropius, occurs seven hundred years after its founding. 

Finally, in section 2.7, Eutropius asserts that the end of the Latin War (340 – 338 BCE) was synchronous with the founding of Alexandria. This assertion turns out to be inaccurate, however, as Alexander founded his eponymous Egyptian metropolis closer to 331 BCE.
